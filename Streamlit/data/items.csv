Time-Series Analysis,Quantitative Methods,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," As financial analysts, we often use time-series data to make investment decisions. Atime seriesis a set of observations on a variable’s outcomes in different time periods: the quarterly sales for a particular company during the past five years, for example, or the daily returns on a traded security. In this reading, we explore the two chief uses of time-series models: to explain the past and to predict the future of a time series. We also discuss how to estimate time-series models, and we examine how a model describing a particular time series can change over time. The following two examples illustrate the kinds of questions we might want to ask about time series. Suppose it is the beginning of 2020 and we are managing a US-based investment portfolio that includes Swiss stocks. Because the value of this portfolio would decrease if the Swiss franc depreciates with respect to the dollar, and vice versa, holding all else constant, we are considering whether to hedge the portfolio’s exposure to changes in the value of the franc. To help us in making this decision, we decide to model the time series of the franc/dollar exchange rate. Exhibit 1 shows monthly data on the franc/dollar exchange rate. The data are monthly averages of daily exchange rates. Has the exchange rate been more stable since 1987 than it was in previous years? Has the exchange rate shown a long-term trend? How can we best use past exchange rates to predict future exchange rates? As another example, suppose it is the beginning of 2020. We cover retail stores for a sell-side firm and want to predict retail sales for the coming year. Exhibit 2 shows monthly data on US retail sales. The data are not seasonally adjusted, hence the spikes around the holiday season at the turn of each year. Because the reported sales in the stores’ financial statements are not seasonally adjusted, we model seasonally unadjusted retail sales. How can we model the trend in retail sales? How can we adjust for the extreme seasonality reflected in the peaks and troughs occurring at regular intervals? How can we best use past retail sales to predict future retail sales? Some fundamental questions arise in time-series analysis: How do we model trends? How do we predict the future value of a time series based on its past values? How do we model seasonality? How do we choose among time-series models? And how do we model changes in the variance of time series over time? We address each of these issues in this reading. We first describe typical challenges in applying the linear regression model to time-series data. We present linear and log-linear trend models, which describe, respectively, the value and the natural log of the value of a time series as a linear function of time. We then present autoregressive time-series models—which explain the current value of a time series in terms of one or more lagged values of the series. Such models are among the most commonly used in investments, and the section addresses many related concepts and issues. We then turn our attention to random walks. Because such time series are not covariance stationary, they cannot be modeled using autoregressive models unless they can be transformed into stationary series. We therefore explore appropriate transformations and tests of stationarity. The subsequent sections address moving-average time-series models and discuss the problem of seasonality in time series and how to address it. We also cover autoregressive moving-average models, a more complex alternative to autoregressive models. The last two topics are modeling changing variance of the error term in a time series and the consequences of regression of one time series on another when one or both time series may not be covariance stationary.

Credit Analysis Models,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Credit analysis plays an important role in the broader fixed-income space. Our coverage will go over important concepts, tools, and applications of credit analysis. We first look at modeling credit risk. The inputs to credit risk modeling are the expected exposure to default loss, the loss given default, and the probability of default. We explain these terms and use a numerical example to illustrate the calculation of the credit valuation adjustment for a corporate bond and its credit spread over a government bond yield taken as a proxy for a default-risk-free rate (or default-free rate). We then discuss credit scoring and credit ratings. Credit scoring is a measure of credit risk used in retail loan markets, and ratings are used in the wholesale bond market. We explain two types of credit analysis models used in practice—structural models and reduced-form models. Both models are highly mathematical and beyond the scope of our coverage. Therefore, we provide only an overview to highlight the key ideas and the similarities and differences between them. We then use the arbitrage-free framework and a binomial interest rate tree to value risky fixed-rate and floating-rate bonds for different assumptions about interest rate volatility. We also build on the credit risk model to interpret changes in credit spreads that arise from changes in the assumed probability of default, the recovery rate, or the exposure to default loss. We also explain the term structure of credit spreads and finally compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt with the credit analysis of corporate bonds.

Introduction to Alternative Investments,Alternative Investments,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," In this section, we explain what alternative investments are and why assets under management in alternative investments have grown in recent decades. We also explain how alternative investments differ from traditional investments, and we examine their perceived investment merit. We conclude this section with a brief overview of the various categories of alternative investments; these categories will be explored further in later sections. “Alternative investments” is a label for a disparate group of investments that are distinguished from long-only, publicly traded investments in stocks, bonds, and cash (often referred to as traditional investments). The terms “traditional” and “alternative” should not imply that alternatives are necessarily uncommon or that they are relatively recent additions to the investment universe. Alternative investments include such assets as real estate and commodities, which are arguably two of the oldest types of investments. Alternative investments also include non-traditional approaches to investing within special vehicles, such as private equity funds and hedge funds. These funds may give the manager flexibility to use derivatives and leverage, to make investments in illiquid assets, and to take short positions. The assets in which these vehicles invest can include traditional assets (stocks, bonds, and cash) as well as less traditional assets. Management of alternative investments is typically active. Alternative investments often have many of the following characteristics:  ","describe types and categories of alternative investments;

Valuation of Contingent Claims,Derivatives,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," A contingent claim is a derivative instrument that provides its owner a right but
not an obligation to a payoff determined by an underlying asset, rate, or other derivative.
Contingent claims include options, the valuation of which is the objective of this
reading. Because many investments contain embedded options, understanding this material
is vital for investment management. Our primary purpose is to understand how the values of options are determined. Option
values, as with the values of all financial instruments, are typically obtained using
valuation models. Any financial valuation model takes certain inputs and turns them
into an output that tells us the fair value or price. Option valuation models, like
their counterparts in the forward, futures, and swaps markets, are based on the principle
of no arbitrage, meaning that the appropriate price of an option is the one that makes
it impossible for any party to earn an arbitrage profit at the expense of any other
party. The price that precludes arbitrage profits is the value of the option. Using
that concept, we then proceed to introduce option valuation models using two approaches.
The first approach is the binomial model, which is based on discrete time, and the
second is the Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) model, which is based on continuous time. The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the principles of the no-arbitrage
approach to pricing and valuation of options. In Section 3, the binomial option valuation
model is explored, and in Section 4, the BSM model is covered. In Section 5, the Black
model, being a variation of the BSM model, is applied to futures options, interest
rate options, and swaptions. Finally, in Section 6, the Greeks are reviewed along
with implied volatility. Section 7 provides a summary.  ","describe and interpret the binomial option valuation model and its component terms;

Introduction to Commodities and Commodity Derivatives,Alternative Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," In the upcoming sections, we present the characteristics and valuation of commodities
               and commodity derivatives. Given that investment in commodities is conducted primarily
               through futures markets, the concepts and theories behind commodity futures is a primary
               focus of the reading. In particular, the relationship between spot and futures prices,
               as well as the underlying components of futures returns, are key analytical considerations. What do we mean when we talk about investing in commodities? A basic economic definition
               is that a commodity is a physical good attributable to a natural resource that is
               tradable and supplied without substantial differentiation by the general public. Commodities trade in physical (spot) markets and in futures and forward markets. Spot
               markets involve the physical transfer of goods between buyers and sellers; prices
               in these markets reflect current (or very near term) supply and demand conditions.
               Global commodity futures markets constitute financial exchanges of standardized futures
               contracts in which a price is established in the market today for the sale of some
               defined quantity and quality of a commodity at a future date of delivery; completion
               of the contract may permit cash settlement or require physical delivery. Commodity futures exchanges allow for risk transfer and provide a valuable price discovery
               mechanism that reflects the collective views of all market participants with regard
               to the future supply and demand prospects of a commodity. Given the financial (versus
               physical) nature of their contract execution, commodity exchanges allow important
               parties beyond traditional suppliers and buyers—speculators, arbitrageurs, private
               equity, endowments, and other institutional investors—to participate in these price
               discovery and risk transfer processes. Standardized contracts and organized exchanges
               also offer liquidity (i.e., trading volumes) to facilitate closing, reducing, expanding,
               or opening new hedges or exposures as circumstances change on a daily basis. Forward markets exist alongside futures markets in certain commodities for use by
               entities that require customization in contract terms. Forwards are largely outside
               the scope of this reading and are discussed only briefly. Exposure to commodities
               is also traded in the swap markets for both speculative and hedging purposes. Investment
               managers may want to establish swap positions to match certain portfolio needs, whereas
               producers may want to more precisely adjust their commodity risk (e.g., the origin
               of their cattle or the chemical specifications of their crude oil). Commodities offer the potential for diversification benefits in a multi-asset class
               portfolio because of historically low average return correlation with stocks and bonds.
               In addition, certain academic studies (e.g., Gorton and Rouwenhorst 2006; Erb and
               Harvey 2006) demonstrate that some commodities have historically had inflation hedging
               qualities. Our coverage of the commodities topic is organized as follows: We provide an overview
               of physical commodity markets, including the major sectors, their life cycles, and
               their valuation. We then describe futures market participants, commodity futures pricing,
               and the analysis of commodity returns, including the concepts of contango and backwardation.
               The subsequent section reviews the use of swap instruments rather than futures to
               gain exposure to commodities. We then review the various commodity indexes given their
               importance as benchmarks for the asset class and investment vehicles. Finally, we
               conclude with a summary of the major points.  ","compare characteristics of commodity sectors;

Understanding Income Statements,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company’s
               business activities over a period of time. The income statement communicates how much
               revenue the company generated during a period and what costs it incurred in connection
               with generating that revenue. The basic equation underlying the income statement,
               ignoring gains and losses, is Revenue minus Expenses equals Net income. The income
               statement is also sometimes referred to as the “statement of operations,” “statement
               of earnings,” or “profit and loss (P&L) statement.” Under both International Financial
               Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP),
               the income statement may be presented as a separate statement followed by a statement
               of comprehensive income that begins with the profit or loss from the income statement
               or as a section of a single statement of comprehensive income.
                This reading focuses on the income statement, and the termincome statementwill be used to describe either the separate statement that reports profit or loss
               used for earnings per share calculations or that section of a statement of comprehensive
               income that reports the same profit or loss. The reading also includes a discussion
               of comprehensive income (profit or loss from the income statement plus other comprehensive
               income). Investment analysts intensely scrutinize companies’ income statements. Equity analysts
               are interested in them because equity markets often reward relatively high- or low-earnings
               growth companies with above-average or below-average valuations, respectively, and
               because inputs into valuation models often include estimates of earnings. Fixed-income
               analysts examine the components of income statements, past and projected, for information
               on companies’ abilities to make promised payments on their debt over the course of
               the business cycle. Corporate financial announcements frequently emphasize information
               reported in income statements, particularly earnings, more than information reported
               in the other financial statements. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the components of the income
               statement and its format. Section 3 describes basic principles and selected applications
               related to the recognition of revenue, and Section 4 describes basic principles and
               selected applications related to the recognition of expenses. Section 5 covers non-recurring
               items and non-operating items. Section 6 explains the calculation of earnings per
               share. Section 7 introduces income statement analysis, and Section 8 explains comprehensive
               income and its reporting. A summary of the key points and practice problems in the

Pricing and Valuation of Forward Commitments,Derivatives,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Forward commitments include forwards, futures, and swaps. A forward contract is a promise to buy or sell an asset at a future date at a price agreed to at the contract’s initiation. The forward contract has a linear payoff function, with both upside and downside risk. A swap is essentially a promise to undertake a transaction at a set price or rate at several dates in the future. The technique we use to price and value swaps is to identify and construct a portfolio with cash flows equivalent to those of the swap. Then, we can use tools, such as the law of one price, to determine swap values from simpler financial instruments, such as a pair of bonds with a cash flow pattern similar to those of our swap. Look out for the big picture: value additivity, arbitrage, and the law of one price are important valuation concepts. Forwards and swaps are widely used in practice to manage a broad range of market risks. As well, more complex derivative instruments can sometimes be understood in terms of their basic building blocks: forwards and option-based components. Here are just some of the many and varied uses for forwards, futures, and swaps that you might encounter in your investment career:  ","describe the carry arbitrage model without underlying cashflows and with underlying

Private Equity Investments,Alternative Investments,"2023
 Curriculum",Level II," Private equity’s shift from a niche activity to a critical component of the financial
system is evident from investors’ financial commitment: around $2.8 trillion globally
as of mid-2018. And that’s just the equity portion. The use of debt means transaction
value is often two or three times the actual equity raised. Blackstone, Carlyle, and
KKR are household names and publicly traded companies of significant size. Private
equity funds may account for 15%–18% of the value of all mergers and acquisitions,
and the market capitalization of Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, and Google has raised
the profile of venture capital investing. We take two approaches to illuminate our subject: In Section 2 the perspective is
primarily that of the private equity firm evaluating potential investments. Valuing
acquisitions is particularly complex; except for public-to-private transactions, there
will be no market prices to refer to, and the challenges are considerable. In Section
3 we take the perspective of an outside investor investing in a fund sponsored by
the private equity firm. Definitions of private equity differ, but here we include the entire asset class of
equity investments that are not quoted on stock markets. Private equity stretches
from venture capital (VC)—working with early-stage companies that may be without revenues
but that possess good ideas or technology—to growth equity, providing capital to expand
established private businesses often by taking a minority interest, all the way to
large buyouts (leveraged buyouts, or LBOs), in which the private equity firm buys
the entire company. When the target is publicly traded, the private equity fund performs
a public-to-private transaction, removing the target from the stock market. But buyout
transactions usually involve private companies and very often a particular division
of an existing company. Some exclude venture capital from the private equity universe because of the higher
risk profile of backing new companies as opposed to mature ones. For this reading,
we refer simply toventure capitalandbuyoutsas the two main forms of private equity. Many classifications of private equity are available. Classifications proposed by
the European and Private Equity Venture Capital Association (EVCA) are displayed in
Exhibit 1. Private equity funds may also be classified geographically, by sector, or both. Certain
specialists target real asset classes, such as real estate, infrastructure, energy,
and timber, or they seek out emerging or niche sectors, such as agribusiness or royalties
in pharmaceuticals, music, film, or TV. US private equity enjoyed a far larger market size historically than private equity
in other regions, with few restrictions on hostile takeovers. Buyouts subsequently
expanded to Europe and then Asia as friendly deals became commonplace. In broad terms,
around four-fifths of the money has been flowing into buyout, growth, and other types
of private equity in both the United States and Europe, with buyout amounts far exceeding
other types. The sheer scale of buyouts means that an individual deal can absorb billions
of dollars in capital. Buyout funds have benefited from increased allocations given
their ability to absorb far higher capital amounts and to deliver historically higher-than-average
returns. Venture capital deals, in contrast, tend to drip, providing small amounts of feed
money. Still, advances in technology and communications are causing the number of
venture capital funds and the availability of start-up capital to grow. Investor attention
started to shift to China in 2015, an especially active year for raising capital.
VC funds targeting Asia had more than US$200 billion in 2017, up from US$50 billion
in 2010. Most private equity money comes from institutional investors, such as pension funds,
sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and insurance companies, although many family
offices and high-net-worth individuals also invest directly or through fund-of-funds
intermediaries. Venture capital investors include government agencies and corporations
seeking to promote regional investment or gain insight into, and possibly control
of, emerging businesses and technologies. Private equity investment is characterized by a buy-to-sell orientation: Investors
typically expect their money to be returned, with a handsome profit, within 10 years
of committing their funds. The economic incentives of the funds are aligned with this
goal.  ","explain sources of value creation in private equity;

Valuation and Analysis of Bonds with Embedded Options,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," The valuation of a fixed-rate, option-free bond generally requires determining its future cash flows and discounting them at the appropriate rates. Valuation becomes more complicated when a bond has one or more embedded options because the values of embedded options are typically contingent on interest rates. Understanding how to value and analyze bonds with embedded options is important for practitioners. Issuers of bonds often manage interest rate exposure with embedded options, such as call provisions. Investors in callable bonds must appreciate the risk of being called. The perception of this risk is collectively represented by the premium, in terms of increased coupon or yield, that the market demands for callable bonds relative to otherwise identical option-free bonds. Issuers and investors must also understand how other types of embedded options—such as put provisions, conversion options, caps, and floors—affect bond values and the sensitivity of these bonds to interest rate movements. We first provide a brief overview of various types of embedded options. We then discuss bonds that include a call or put provision. Taking a building-block approach, we show how the arbitrage-free valuation framework discussed earlier can be applied to the valuation of callable and putable bonds—first in the absence of interest rate volatility, and then when interest rates fluctuate. We also discuss how option-adjusted spreads are used to value risky callable and putable bonds. We then turn to interest rate sensitivity. It highlights the need to use effective duration, including one-sided durations and key rate durations, as well as effective convexity to assess the effect of interest rate movements on the value of callable and putable bonds. We also explain the valuation of capped and floored floating-rate bonds (floaters) and convertible bonds.  ","describe fixed-income securities with embedded options;

Private Company Valuation,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," The valuation of the equity of private companies is a major field of application for
               equity valuation. Private companies are those whose shares are not listed on public
               markets. Generalist investment practitioners need to be familiar with issues associated
               with valuations of such companies. We use the terms “valuation” and “appraisal” interchangeably
               in this chapter. Many public companies have start-up or other operations that can best be valued as
               if they were private companies. Companies may grow through the acquisition of competitors,
               including private companies, and analysts must be prepared to evaluate the price paid
               in such transactions. Furthermore, acquisitions often result in significant balances
               of intangible assets, including goodwill, that are reported on the balance sheets
               of acquiring companies. Goodwill balances require impairment assessment or formal
               testing on an annual basis under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
               and US GAAP. Impairment testing and other financial reporting initiatives increasingly
               result in the use of fair value estimates in financial statements. The concepts and
               methods we will discuss play important roles in this aspect of financial reporting.
               In addition, issues relating to private company valuation arise in the types of investment
               held by venture capital and other types of private equity funds. The following sections illustrate key elements associated with the valuation of private
               companies and provide background for understanding private company valuation, including
               typical contrasts between public and private companies and the major purposes for
               which private valuations are performed. Later sections discuss earnings normalization
               and cash flow estimation; introduce the three major approaches recognized in private
               company valuation, valuation discounts, and premiums; and explain business valuation

Market-Based Valuation: Price and Enterprise Value Multiples,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Among the most familiar and widely used valuation tools are price and enterprise value
multiples.Price multiplesare ratios of a stock’s market price to some measure of fundamental value per share.Enterprise value multiples, by contrast, relate the total market value of all sources of a company’s capital
to a measure of fundamental value for the entire company. The intuition behind price multiples is that investors evaluate the price of a share
of stock—judge whether it is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued—by considering
what a share buys in terms of per share earnings, net assets, cash flow, or some other
measure of value (stated on a per share basis). The intuition behind enterprise value
multiples is similar; investors evaluate the market value of an entire enterprise
relative to the amount of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
(EBITDA), sales, or operating cash flow it generates. As valuation indicators (measures
or indicators of value), multiples have the appealing qualities of simplicity in use
and ease in communication. A multiple summarizes in a single number the relationship
between the market value of a company’s stock (or of its total capital) and some fundamental
quantity, such as earnings, sales, orbook value(owners’ equity based on accounting values). Among the questions we will study for answers that will help in making correct use
of multiples as valuation tools are the following: Multiples may be viewed as valuation indicators relating to individual securities.
Another type of valuation indicator used in security selection ismomentum indicators. They typically relate either price or a fundamental (such as earnings) to the time
series of its own past values or, in some cases, to its expected value. The logic
behind the use of momentum indicators is that such indicators may provide information
on future patterns of returns over some time horizon. Because the purpose of momentum
indicators is to identify potentially rewarding investment opportunities, they can
be viewed as a class of valuation indicators with a focus that is different from and
complementary to the focus of price and enterprise value multiples. We first put the use of price and enterprise value multiples in an economic context
and present certain themes common to the use of any price or enterprise value multiple.
We then present price multiples. The treatment of each multiple follows a common format:
usage considerations, the relationship of the multiple to investors’ expectations
about fundamentals, and using the multiple in valuation based on comparables. The
subsequent sections present enterprise value multiples, international considerations
in using multiples, and treatment of momentum indicators. We then discuss several
practical issues that arise in using valuation indicators.  ","distinguish between the method of comparables and the method based on forecasted fundamentals

Machine Learning,Quantitative Methods,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Investment firms are increasingly using technology at every step of the investment management value chain—from improving their understanding of clients to uncovering new sources of alpha and executing trades more efficiently. Machine learning techniques, a central part of that technology, are the subject of this reading. These techniques first appeared in finance in the 1990s and have since flourished with the explosion of data and cheap computing power. This reading provides a high-level view of machine learning (ML). It covers a selection of key ML algorithms and their investment applications. Investment practitioners should be equipped with a basic understanding of the types of investment problems that machine learning can address, an idea of how the algorithms work, and the vocabulary to interact with machine learning and data science experts. While investment practitioners need not master the details and mathematics of machine learning, as domain experts in investments they can play an important role in the implementation of these techniques by being able to source appropriate model inputs, interpret model outputs, and translate outputs into appropriate investment actions. Section 1 gives an overview of machine learning in investment management. Section 2 defines machine learning and the types of problems that can be addressed by supervised and unsupervised learning. Section 3 describes evaluating machine learning algorithm performance. Key supervised machine learning algorithms are covered in Sections 4–8, and Sections 9–12 describe key unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Neural networks, deep learning nets, and reinforcement learning are covered in Sections 13 and 14. Section 15 provides a decision flowchart for selecting the appropriate ML algorithm.

Equity Valuation: Applications and Processes,Equity Investments,"2023
 Curriculum",Level II," Every day, thousands of participants in the investment profession—investors, portfolio
managers, regulators, researchers—face a common and often perplexing question: What
is the value of a particular asset? The answers to this question usually influence
success or failure in achieving investment objectives. For one group of those participants—equity
analysts—the question and its potential answers are particularly critical because
determining the value of an ownership stake is at the heart of their professional
activities and decisions.Valuationis the estimation of an asset’s value based on variables perceived to be related
to future investment returns, on comparisons with similar assets, or, when relevant,
on estimates of immediate liquidation proceeds. Skill in valuation is a very important
element of success in investing. We address some basic questions: What is value? Who uses equity valuations? What is
the importance of industry knowledge? How can the analyst effectively communicate
his analysis? We answer these and other questions and lay a foundation for the topics
that follow. The following section defines value and describes the various uses of equity valuation.

Employee Compensation: Post-Employment and Share-Based,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," This reading covers two complex aspects of employee compensation: post-employment
               (retirement) benefits and share-based compensation. Retirement benefits include pensions
               and other post-employment benefits, such as health insurance. Examples of share-based
               compensation are stock options and stock grants. A common issue underlying both of these aspects of employee compensation is the difficulty
               in measuring the value of the compensation. One factor contributing to the difficulty
               is that employees earn the benefits in the periods that they provide service but typically
               receive the benefits in future periods, so measurement requires a significant number
               of assumptions. This reading provides an overview of the methods companies use to estimate and measure
               the benefits they provide to their employees and how this information is reported
               in financial statements. There has been some convergence between International Financial
               Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)
               in the measurement and accounting treatment for pensions, other post-employment benefits,
               and share-based compensation, but some differences remain. Although this reading focuses
               on IFRS as the basis for discussion, instances where US GAAP significantly differ
               are discussed. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 addresses pensions and other post-employment
               benefits, and Section 3 covers share-based compensation with a primary focus on the
               accounting for and analysis of stock options. A summary and practice problems conclude

Economic Growth,Economics,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Forecasts of long-run economic growth are important for global investors. Equity prices
               reflect expectations of the future stream of earnings, which depend on expectations
               of future economic activity. This dynamic means that in the long term, the same factors
               that drive economic growth will be reflected in equity values. Similarly, the expected
               long-run growth rate of real income is a key determinant of the average real interest
               rate level in the economy, and therefore the level of real returns in general. In
               the shorter term, the relationship between actual and potential growth (i.e., the
               degree of slack in the economy) is a key driver of fixed-income returns. Therefore,
               in order to develop global portfolio strategies and investment return expectations,
               investors must be able to identify and forecast the factors that drive long-term sustainable
               growth trends. Based on a country’s long-term economic outlook, investors can then
               evaluate the long-term investment potential and risk of investing in the securities
               of companies located or operating in that country. In contrast to the short-run fluctuations of the business cycle, the study of economic
               growth focuses on the long-run trend in aggregate output as measured by potential
               GDP. Over long periods, the actual growth rate of GDP should equal the rate of increase
               in potential GDP because, by definition, output in excess of potential GDP requires
               employing labor and capital beyond their optimum levels. Thus, the growth rate of
               potential GDP acts as an upper limit to growth and determines the economy’s sustainable
               rate of growth. Increasing the growth rate of potential GDP is the key to raising
               the level of income, the level of profits, and the living standard of the population.
               Even small differences in the growth rate translate into large differences in the
               level of income over time. What drives long-run growth? What distinguishes the “winners” from the “losers” in
               the long-run growth arena? Will poor countries catch up with rich countries over time?
               Can policies have a permanent effect on the sustainable growth rate? If so, how? If
               not, why not? These and other key questions are addressed in detail in this reading. We first examine the long-term growth record, focusing on the extent of growth variation
               across countries and across decades. We then discuss the importance of economic growth
               to global investors and examine the relationship between investment returns and economic
               growth. We next turn to the factors that determine long-run economic growth before
               presenting the classical, neoclassical, and endogenous growth models. We also discuss
               whether poorer countries are converging to the higher income levels of the richer
               countries. Finally, we look at the impact of international trade on economic growth.  ","compare factors favoring and limiting economic growth in developed and developing

Multinational Operations,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," According to the World Trade Organization, merchandise exports worldwide were nearly
US$15 trillion in 2010.
The amount of worldwide merchandise exports in 2010 was more than twice the amount
in 2003 (US$7.4 trillion) and more than four times the amount in 1993 (US$3.7 trillion).
The top five exporting countries in 2010, in order, were China, the United States,
Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands. In the United States alone, 293,131 companies
were identified as exporters in 2010, but only 2.2% of those companies were large
(more than 500 employees).
The vast majority of US companies with export activity were small or medium-sized
entities. The point illustrated by these statistics is that many companies engage in transactions
that cross national borders. The parties to these transactions must agree on the currency
in which to settle the transaction. Generally, this will be the currency of either
the buyer or the seller. Exporters that receive payment in foreign currency and allow
the purchaser time to pay must carry a foreign currency receivable on their books.
Conversely, importers that agree to pay in foreign currency will have a foreign currency
account payable. To be able to include them in the total amount of accounts receivable
(payable) reported on the balance sheet, these foreign currency denominated accounts
receivable (payable) must be translated into the currency in which the exporter (importer)
keeps its books and presents financial statements. The prices at which foreign currencies can be purchased or sold are called foreign
exchange rates. Because foreign exchange rates fluctuate over time, the value of foreign
currency payables and receivables also fluctuates. The major accounting issue related
to foreign currency transactions is how to reflect the changes in value for foreign
currency payables and receivables in the financial statements. Many companies have operations located in foreign countries. For example, the Swiss food products company Nestlé SA reports that it has factories in 83 countries and a presence in almost every country in the world. US-based Procter & Gamble’s annual filing discloses more than 400 subsidiaries located in more than 80 countries around the world. Foreign subsidiaries are generally required to keep accounting records in the currency of the country in which they are located. To prepare consolidated financial statements, the parent company must translate the foreign currency financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries into its own currency. Nestlé, for example, must translate the assets and liabilities its various foreign subsidiaries carry in foreign currency into Swiss francs to be able to consolidate those amounts with the Swiss franc assets and liabilities located in Switzerland. A multinational company like Nestlé is likely to have two types of foreign currency activities that require special accounting treatment. Most multinationals (1) engage in transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency and (2) invest in foreign subsidiaries that keep their books in a foreign currency. To prepare consolidated financial statements, a multinational company must translate the foreign currency amounts related to both types of international activities into the currency in which the company presents its financial statements. This reading presents the accounting for foreign currency transactions and the translation
of foreign currency financial statements. The conceptual issues related to these accounting
topics are discussed, and the specific rules embodied in International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP are demonstrated through examples. Fortunately, differences
between IFRS and US GAAP with respect to foreign currency translation issues are minimal. Analysts need to understand the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the
financial statements of a multinational company and how a company’s financial statements
reflect foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or not.  ","distinguish among presentation (reporting) currency, functional currency, and local

Intercorporate Investments,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Intercorporate investments (investments in other companies) can have a significant
               impact on an investing company’s financial performance and position. Companies invest
               in the debt and equity securities of other companies to diversify their asset base,
               enter new markets, obtain competitive advantages, deploy excess cash, and achieve
               additional profitability. Debt securities include commercial paper, corporate and
               government bonds and notes, redeemable preferred stock, and asset-backed securities.
               Equity securities include common stock and non-redeemable preferred stock. The percentage
               of equity ownership a company acquires in an investee depends on the resources available,
               the ability to acquire the shares, and the desired level of influence or control. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US Financial Accounting
               Standards Board (FASB) worked to reduce differences in accounting standards that apply
               to the classification, measurement, and disclosure of intercorporate investments.
               The resulting standards have improved the relevance, transparency, and comparability
               of information provided in financial statements. Complete convergence between IFRS accounting standards and US GAAP did not occur for
               accounting for financial instruments, and some differences still exist. The terminology
               used in this reading is IFRS-oriented. US GAAP may not use identical terminology,
               but in most cases the terminology is similar. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the basic categorization
               of corporate investments. Section 3 describes reporting under IFRS 9, the IASB standard
               for financial instruments. Section 4 describes equity method reporting for investments
               in associates where significant influence can exist including the reporting for joint
               ventures, a type of investment where control is shared. Section 5 describes reporting

Evaluating Quality of Financial Reports,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," The ability to assess the quality of reported financial information can be a valuable
skill. An analyst or investor who can recognize high-quality financial reporting can
have greater confidence in analysis based on those financial reports and the resulting
investment decisions. Similarly, an analyst or investor who can recognize poor financial
reporting quality early—before deficiencies become widely known—is more likely to
make profitable investment decisions or to reduce or even avoid losses. An example of early recognition of an ultimate financial disaster is James Chanos’s
short position in Enron in November 2000 —more than a year before Enron filed for bankruptcy protection (in December 2001).
Despite Enron’s high profile and reputation,
Chanos had a negative view of Enron based on both quantitative and qualitative factors.
Chanos noted that Enron’s return on capital was both lower than comparable companies’
return on capital and lower than the company’s own cost of capital. Qualitative factors
contributing to Chanos’s view included the company’s aggressive revenue recognition
policy, its complex and difficult-to-understand disclosures on related-party transactions,
and one-time earnings-boosting gains. Later events that substantiated Chanos’s perspective
included sales of the company’s stock by insiders and the resignation of senior executives. Another example of early recognition of eventual financial troubles is June 2001 reports
by analyst Enitan Adebonojo. These reports highlighted questionable accounting by
Royal Ahold, a European food retailer. The questionable accounting included “claiming
profits of acquired firms as ‘organic growth,’ booking capital gains from sale-and-leaseback
deals as profit, and keeping billions in debt off its balance sheet.”
In 2003, Royal Ahold announced that it had significantly overstated its profits in
the prior two years. The CEO and CFO resigned, various regulators announced investigations,
and Royal Ahold’s market value dropped significantly. This reading focuses on reporting quality and the interrelated attribute of results
quality.Reporting qualitypertains to the information disclosed in financial reports. High-quality reporting
provides decision-useful information—information that is relevant and faithfully represents
the economic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period and the
company’s financial condition at the end of the period. A separate, but interrelated,
attribute of quality isresultsorearnings quality, which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic
activities and the resulting financial condition relative to expectations of current
and future financial performance. Note that the term “earnings quality” is more commonly
used in practice than “results quality,” so throughout this reading, earnings quality
is used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, and/or balance sheet
items. High-quality earnings reflect an adequate level of return on investment and are derived
from activities that a company will likely be able to sustain in the future. Thus,
high-quality earnings increase the value of a company more than low-quality earnings.
When reported earnings are described as being high quality, it means that the company’s
underlying economic performance was good (i.e., value enhancing), and it also implies
that the company had high reporting quality (i.e., that the information that the company
calculated and disclosed was a good reflection of the economic reality). Earnings can be termed “low quality” either because the reported information properly
represents genuinely bad performance or because the reported information misrepresents
economic reality. In theory, a company could have low-quality earnings while simultaneously
having high reporting quality. Consider a company with low-quality earnings—for example,
one whose only source of earnings in a period is a one-off settlement of a lawsuit
without which the company would have reported huge losses. The company could nonetheless
have high reporting quality if it calculated its results properly and provided decision-useful
information. Although it is theoretically possible that a company could have low-quality
earnings while simultaneously having high reporting quality, experiencing poor financial
performance can motivate the company’s management to misreport. This reading begins in Section 2 with a description of a conceptual framework for
and potential problems with financial reporting quality. This is followed in Section
3 with a discussion of how to evaluate financial reporting quality. Sections 4, 5,
and 6 focus on the quality of reported earnings, cash flows, and balance sheets, respectively.
Section 7 covers sources of information about risk. A summary and practice problems
in the CFA Institute item set format complete the reading.  ","demonstrate the use of a conceptual framework for assessing the quality of a company’s

Discounted Dividend Valuation,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Common stock represents an ownership interest in a business. A business in its operations
generates a stream of cash flows, and as owners of the business, common stockholders
have an equity ownership claim on those future cash flows. Beginning with John Burr
Williams (1938), analysts have developed this insight into a group of valuation models known as discounted
cash flow (DCF) valuation models. DCF models—which view the intrinsic value of common
stock as the present value of its expected future cash flows—are a fundamental tool
in both investment management and investment research. Although the principles behind discounted cash flow valuation are simple, applying
the theory to equity valuation can be challenging. Four broad steps in applying DCF
analysis to equity valuation are: In our coverage of this topic, we take the perspective that dividends—distributions
to shareholders authorized by a company’s board of directors—are an appropriate definition
of cash flows. The class of models based on this idea is called dividend discount
models, or DDMs. The basic objective of any DDM is to value a stock. The variety of
implementations corresponds to different ways to model a company’s future stream of
dividend payments. The steps of choosing a discount rate methodology and estimating
the discount rate involve the same considerations for all DCF models, so they have
been presented separately in an earlier discussion. The sections are organized as follows: We first provide an overview of present value
models. We then provide a general statement of the dividend discount model. Forecasting
dividends, individually and in detail, into the indefinite future is not generally
practicable, so the dividend-forecasting problem is usually simplified. One approach
is to assign dividends to a stylized growth pattern. In the subsequent section, we
focus on the simplest pattern—dividends growing at a constant rate forever (the constant
growth or “Gordon growth” model). We then explain that for some companies, it is more
appropriate to view earnings and dividends as having multiple stages of growth. We
present multistage dividend discount models along with spreadsheet modeling. We lay
out the determinants of dividend growth rates in the last section and conclude with
a summary.  ","compare dividends, free cash flow, and residual income as inputs to discounted cash

Residual Income Valuation,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Residual income models of equity value have become widely recognized tools in both
               investment practice and research. Conceptually, residual income is net income less
               a charge (deduction) for common shareholders’ opportunity cost in generating net income.
               It is the residual or remaining income after considering the costs of all of a company’s
               capital. The appeal of residual income models stems from a shortcoming of traditional
               accounting. Specifically, although a company’s income statement includes a charge
               for the cost of debt capital in the form of interest expense, it does not include
               a charge for the cost of equity capital. A company can have positive net income but
               may still not be adding value for shareholders if it does not earn more than its cost
               of equity capital. Residual income models explicitly recognize the costs of all the
               capital used in generating income. As an economic concept, residual income has a long history, dating back to Alfred
               Marshall in the late 1800s (Alfred Marshall, 1890). As far back as the 1920s, General
               Motors used the concept in evaluating business segments. More recently, residual income
               has received renewed attention and interest, sometimes under names such as economic
               profit, abnormal earnings, or economic value added. Although residual income concepts
               have been used in a variety of contexts, including the measurement of internal corporate
               performance, we will focus on the residual income model for estimating the intrinsic
               value of common stock. Among the questions we will study to help us apply residual
               income models are the following: The following section develops the concept of residual income, introduces the use
               of residual income in valuation, and briefly presents alternative measures used in
               practice. The subsequent sections present the residual income model and illustrate
               its use in valuing common stock, show practical applications, and describe the relative
               strengths and weaknesses of residual income valuation compared with other valuation
               methods. The last section addresses accounting issues in the use of residual income
               valuation. We then conclude with a summary.  ","calculate and interpret residual income, economic value added, and market value added;

Free Cash Flow Valuation,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation views the intrinsic value of a security as the
present value of its expected future cash flows. When applied to dividends, the DCF
model is the discounted dividend approach or dividend discount model (DDM). Our coverage
extends DCF analysis to value a company and its equity securities by valuing free
cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE). Whereas dividends
are the cash flows actually paid to stockholders, free cash flows are the cash flowsavailablefor distribution to shareholders. Unlike dividends, FCFF and FCFE are not readily available data. Analysts need to compute
these quantities from available financial information, which requires a clear understanding
of free cash flows and the ability to interpret and use the information correctly.
Forecasting future free cash flows is a rich and demanding exercise. The analyst’s
understanding of a company’s financial statements, its operations, its financing,
and its industry can pay real “dividends” as he or she addresses that task. Many analysts
consider free cash flow models to be more useful than DDMs in practice. Free cash
flows provide an economically sound basis for valuation. A study of professional analysts substantiates the importance of free cash flow valuation
(Pinto, Robinson, Stowe 2019). When valuing individual equities, 92.8% of analysts use market multiples and 78.8%
use a discounted cash flow approach. When using discounted cash flow analysis, 20.5%
of analysts use a residual income approach, 35.1% use a dividend discount model, and
86.9% use a discounted free cash flow model. Of those using discounted free cash flow
models, FCFF models are used roughly twice as frequently as FCFE models. Analysts
often use more than one method to value equities, and it is clear that free cash flow
analysis is in near universal use. Analysts like to use free cash flow as the return (either FCFF or FCFE) whenever one
or more of the following conditions is present: Common equity can be valued directly by finding the present value of FCFE or indirectly
by first using an FCFF model to estimate the value of the firm and then subtracting
the value of non-common-stock capital (usually debt) to arrive at an estimate of the
value of equity. The purpose of the coverage in the subsequent sections is to develop
the background required to use the FCFF or FCFE approaches to value a company’s equity. In the next section, we define the concepts of free cash flow to the firm and free
cash flow to equity and then present the two valuation models based on discounting
of FCFF and FCFE. We also explore the constant-growth models for valuing FCFF and
FCFE, which are special cases of the general models. The subsequent sections turn
to the vital task of calculating and forecasting FCFF and FCFE. They also explain
multistage free cash flow valuation models and present some of the issues associated
with their application. Analysts usually value operating assets and non-operating
assets separately and then combine them to find the total value of the firm, an approach
described in the last section on this topic.  ","compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE)

Currency Exchange Rates: Understanding Equilibrium Value,Economics,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Exchange rates are well known to follow a random walk, whereby fluctuations from one
               day to the next are unpredictable. The business of currency forecasting can be a humbling
               experience. Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, famously
               noted that “having endeavored to forecast exchange rates for more than half a century,
               I have understandably developed significant humility about my ability in this area.” Hence, our discussion is not about predicting exchange rates but about the tools the
               reader can use to better understand long-run equilibrium value. This outlook helps
               guide the market participant’s decisions with respect to risk exposures, as well as
               whether currency hedges should be implemented and, if so, how they should be managed.
               After discussing the basics of exchange rate transactions, we present the main theories
               for currency determination—starting with the international parity conditions—and then
               describe other important influences, such as current account balances, capital flows,
               and monetary and fiscal policy. Although these fundamentals-based models usually perform poorly in predicting future
               exchange rates in the short run, they are crucial for understanding long-term currency
               value. Thus, we proceed as follows:  ","calculate and interpret the bid–offer spread on a spot or forward currency quotation
                     and describe the factors that affect the bid–offer spread;
identify a triangular arbitrage opportunity and calculate its profit, given the bid–offer
                     quotations for three currencies;
distinguish between spot and forward rates and calculate the forward premium/discount
                     for a given currency;
calculate the mark-to-market value of a forward contract;

                     forward rate parity, purchasing power parity, and the international Fisher effect);
describe relations among the international parity conditions;
evaluate the use of the current spot rate, the forward rate, purchasing power parity,
                     and uncovered interest parity to forecast future spot exchange rates;

describe the carry trade and its relation to uncovered interest rate parity and calculate
                     the profit from a carry trade;

Economics of Regulation,Economics,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Regulation can be described as a form of government intervention in markets that involves
               rules and their enforcement. It is an important topic because regulation has potential
               effects not only at the macro level on the economy but also at the micro level on
               companies and individuals. Regulation may develop either proactively in anticipation
               of consequences of changes in the market environment or reactively in response to
               some occurrence(s). For example, changes that resulted from technological advances
               in the markets because of new means of communication and applications of computers
               have led to a variety of regulation, both proactive and reactive. Regulation has also
               developed in response to financial crises and undesirable behaviors or actions that
               have occurred in the past. Regulations are necessary because in some situations market
               solutions are inadequate. In other words, regulations exist to protect end users from
               market failings. A significant challenge for financial regulators is how to deal with systemic risk
               (the risk of failure of the financial system) and the consequences of risk taking
               by financial institutions. Issues such as labor regulation, environmental regulation,
               and electronic privacy are also receiving increased attention. How regulations are developed and applied can have significant impacts on businesses.
               Changes in regulatory framework and regulatory uncertainty can also have substantial
               effects on business decisions. So, one of the significant challenges facing professionals
               in the finance industry is to anticipate and understand the consequences of potential
               changes in the regulatory environment and of specific regulations. In the following sections, we describe the economic rationale of regulation, including
               how regulation improves fairness in markets and addresses the danger to society of
               financial system failure. We also provide an overview of regulators, the tools at
               their disposal, and how the work of regulators around the globe is interdependent.
               Lastly, we describe the assessment of costs and benefits of regulation and highlight
               practical issues that arise from the implementation of regulation.  ","describe the economic rationale for regulatory intervention;

Integration of Financial Statement Analysis Techniques,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," It is important to keep in mind that financial analysis is a means to an end and not
the end itself. Rather than try to apply every possible technique and tool to every
situation, it is essential for the investor to consider and identify the proper type
of analysis to apply in a given situation. The primary reason for performing financial analysis is to help in making an economic
decision. Before making such decisions as whether to lend to a particular long-term
borrower or to invest a large sum in a common stock, venture capital vehicle, or private
equity candidate, an investor or financial decision-maker wants to make sure that
the probability of a successful outcome is on his or her side. Rather than leave outcomes
to chance, a financial decision-maker should use financial analysis to identify and
make more visible potential favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The purpose of this reading is to provide examples of the effective use of financial
analysis in decision making. The framework for the analysis is shown in . The case study follows the basic framework shown in .  ","demonstrate the use of a framework for the analysis of financial statements, given
    a particular problem, question, or purpose (e.g., valuing equity based on comparables,

The Term Structure and Interest Rate Dynamics,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Interest rates are both a barometer of the economy and an instrument for its control. The term structure of interest rates—market interest rates at various maturities—is a vital input into the valuation of many financial products. The quantification of interest rate risk is of critical importance to risk managers. Understanding the determinants of interest rates, and thus the drivers of bond returns, is imperative for fixed-income market participants. Here, we explore the tools necessary to understand the term structure and interest rate dynamics—that is, the process by which bond yields and prices evolve over time. Section 1 explains how spot (or current) rates and forward rates, which are set today for a period starting in the future, are related, as well as how their relationship influences yield curve shape. Section 2 builds upon this foundation to show how forward rates impact the yield-to-maturity and expected bond returns. Section 3 explains how these concepts are put into practice by active fixed-income portfolio managers. The swap curve is the term structure of interest rates derived from a periodic exchange of payments based on fixed rates versus short-term market reference rates rather than default-risk-free government bonds. Sections 4 and 5 describe the swap curve and its relationship to government yields, known as the swap spread, and explains their use in valuation. Section 6 describes traditional theories of the term structure of interest rates. These theories outline several qualitative perspectives on economic forces that may affect the shape of the term structure. Section 7 describes yield curve factor models. The focus is a popular three-factor term structure model in which the yield curve changes are described in terms of three independent movements: level, steepness, and curvature. These factors can be extracted from the variance-covariance matrix of historical interest rate movements. Section 8 builds on the factor model and describes how to manage the risk of changing rates over different maturities. Section 9 concludes with a discussion of key variables known to influence interest rates, the development of interest rate views based on forecasts of those variables, and common trades tailored to capitalize on an interest rate view. A summary of key points concludes the reading.  ","describe relationships among spot rates, forward rates, yield to maturity, expected and realized returns on bonds, and the shape of the yield curve;

"Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Considerations in Investment Analysis",Corporate Finance,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly being integrated into investment analysis. Evaluating how ESG factors potentially affect a company may provide analysts with a broader perspective on the risks and investment opportunities of a company’s securities. Although corporate governance has long been recognized as having a significant impact on a company’s long-term performance, investors have become increasingly concerned with environmental and social factors and how companies manage their resources and risk exposures that relate to such factors. Mismanagement of these resources has led to a number of high-profile corporate events that have negatively affected security prices. Increasingly stringent regulatory environments, potentially finite supplies of natural resources, and global trends toward energy conservation and waste reduction have led many investors to place greater emphasis on the management of environmental risks. Similarly, such issues as worker health and safety policies, community impact, and marketing practices have increased the visibility of how a company manages its social capital. This reading provides an overview of ESG considerations in investment analysis. Section 2 provides an overview of the global variations in corporate ownership structures, as well as how these ownership structures may affect corporate governance outcomes. In Section 3, we discuss company-specific factors that should be considered when evaluating corporate governance in the investment process. Section 4 discusses the identification of ESG-related risks and opportunities that are relevant to security analysis. Section 5 demonstrates the evaluation of ESG-related risks and opportunities through several examples. The reading concludes with a summary of the key points discussed.  ","describe global variations in ownership structures and the possible effects of these variations on corporate governance policies and practices;

Hypothesis Testing,Quantitative Methods,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Faced with an overwhelming amount of data, analysts must deal with the task of wrangling those data into something that provides a clearer picture of what is going on. We use the concepts and tools of hypothesis testing to address these issues. Hypothesis testing is part of statistical inference, the process of making judgments about a larger group (a population) based on a smaller group of observations (that is, a sample). The concepts and tools of hypothesis testing provide an objective means to gauge whether the available evidence supports the hypothesis. After applying a statistical test of a hypothesis, we should have a clearer idea of the probability that a hypothesis is true or not, although our conclusion always stops short of certainty. The main focus of this reading is on the framework of hypothesis testing and tests concerning mean, variance, and correlation, three quantities frequently used in investments.  ","define a hypothesis, describe the steps of hypothesis testing, and describe and interpret the choice of the null and alternative hypotheses;

Fundamentals of Credit Analysis,Fixed Income,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," With bonds outstanding worth many trillions of US dollars, the debt markets play a critical role in the global economy. Companies and governments raise capital in the debt market to fund current operations; buy equipment; build factories, roads, bridges, airports, and hospitals; acquire assets; and so on. By channeling savings into productive investments, the debt markets facilitate economic growth. Credit analysis has a crucial function in the debt capital markets—efficiently allocating capital by properly assessing credit risk, pricing it accordingly, and repricing it as risks change. How do fixed-income investors determine the riskiness of that debt, and how do they decide what they need to earn as compensation for that risk? In the sections that follow, we cover basic principles of credit analysis, which may be broadly defined as the process by which credit risk is evaluated. Readers will be introduced to the definition of credit risk, the interpretation of credit ratings, the four Cs of traditional credit analysis, and key financial measures and ratios used in credit analysis. We explain, among other things, how to compare bond issuer creditworthiness within a given industry as well as across industries and how credit risk is priced in the bond market. Our coverage focuses primarily on analysis of corporate debt; however, credit analysis of sovereign and nonsovereign, particularly municipal, government bonds will also be addressed. Structured finance, a segment of the debt markets that includes securities backed by such pools of assets as residential and commercial mortgages as well as other consumer loans, will not be covered here. We first introduce the key components of credit risk—default probability and loss severity— along with such credit-related risks as spread risk, credit migration risk, and liquidity risk. We then discuss the relationship between credit risk and the capital structure of the firm before turning attention to the role of credit rating agencies. We also explore the process of analyzing the credit risk of corporations and examine the impact of credit spreads on risk and return. Finally, we look at special considerations applicable to the analysis of (i) high-yield (low-quality) corporate bonds and (ii) government bonds.

Financial Reporting Standards,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Financial reporting standards provide principles for preparing financial reports and
               determine the types and amounts of information that must be provided to users of financial
               statements, including investors and creditors, so that they may make informed decisions.
               This reading focuses on the context within which these standards are created. An understanding
               of the underlying framework of financial reporting standards, which is broader than
               knowledge of specific accounting rules, will allow an analyst to assess the valuation
               implications of financial statement elements and transactions—including transactions,
               such as those that represent new developments, which are not specifically addressed
               by the standards. Section 2 of this reading discusses the objective of financial reporting and the importance
               of financial reporting standards in security analysis and valuation. Section 3 describes
               the roles of financial reporting standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities
               and several of the financial reporting standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities.

Introduction to Asset-Backed Securities,Fixed Income,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Previous readings examined the risk characteristics of various fixed-income instruments and the relationships between maturity, coupon, and interest rate changes. This reading introduces fixed-income instruments created through a process known as securitization. The securitization process transfers ownership of assets such as loans or receivables from the original owners into a special legal entity. The special legal entity then issues securities, using the asset cash flows to pay interest and repay the principal to investors. These securities are referred to generically as asset-backed securities (ABS), and the pool of assets from which their cash flows are generated is called collateral or securitized assets. These loans and receivables typically include residential mortgage loans (mortgages), commercial mortgages, automobile (auto) loans, student loans, bank loans, accounts receivable, or credit card receivables. While the ABS market in the United States remains the largest in the world, securitization has recently expanded in both Asia and Europe as well as to other income-yielding assets, such as airport landing slots, toll roads, and cell tower leases. The growing depth and breadth of the global ABS market underscores the importance of a solid understanding of securitization among issuers, investors, and financial analysts. This reading describes the securitization process, discusses its benefits for both issuers and investors, and explains the investment characteristics of different types of ABS. Although investors can invest in some loan types via private credit funds or through secondary markets, securitization creates a more direct link between investors and borrowers for many types of loans and receivables. The terminology regarding ABS varies by jurisdiction. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are ABS backed by a pool of mortgages, and a distinction is sometimes made between MBS and ABS backed by non-mortgage assets. This distinction is common in the United States, for example, where typically the term “mortgage-backed securities” refers to securities backed by high-quality real estate mortgages and the term “asset-backed securities” refers to securities backed by other types of assets. Covered bonds date back to 18th century Europe and are similar to ABS, but they offer investors recourse to both the issuing financial institution and an underlying asset pool. To underline the importance of securitization from a macroeconomic perspective, we discuss the benefits of securitization for economies and financial markets. Then, we describe the structure of a securitization, identifying the parties involved and their roles as well as typical structures. We further discuss securities backed by mortgages for real estate property, including residential MBS and commercial MBS, and review two common types of non-mortgage ABS—namely, those for auto loans and credit card receivables. The reading concludes with a description of collateralized debt obligations and covered bonds. Benefits of Securitization for Economies and Financial Markets The securitization of pools of loans and receivables into multiple securities provides economies and financial markets with several benefits. Home or auto purchases have been traditionally financed by loans originated by financial institutions, such as commercial banks. For investors to gain exposure to these relatively illiquid loans, they must hold some combination of deposits, debt, or common equity issued by banks. This situation creates an additional intermediary (that is, the bank) between the borrowers and the investors. In addition, by being constrained to hold bank deposits and securities, investors cannot gain direct exposure to loans but are also affected by economic risks undertaken in other bank activities. Securitization solves a number of these problems. It allows investors to achieve more direct legal claims on loan and receivables portfolios, enabling them to tailor interest rate and credit risk exposures to suit their specific needs. Disintermediation (that is, lessening the role of intermediaries) can effectively reduce borrower costs and enhance risk-adjusted investor returns. At the same time, banks can separate loan origination from financing, improving their profitability via origination fees and reducing capital requirements for loans that are sold. Securitization enables banks to expand lending origination beyond their balance sheets, ultimately benefiting individuals, governments, and companies that need to borrow. Securitization also benefits investors by creating access to securities with profiles that match their risk, return, and maturity needs that are otherwise not directly available. For example, a pension fund with a long-term horizon can gain access to long-term real estate loans by investing in residential MBS without having to invest in bank bonds or stocks. Although few institutional or individual investors are willing to make or purchase real estate loans, auto loans, or credit card receivables directly, they may invest in a security backed by such loans or receivables. The ABS that are created by pooling these loans and receivables have characteristics similar to those of a standard bond and do not require the specialized resources and expertise needed to originate, monitor, and collect the payments from the underlying loans and receivables. As a result, investors can increase exposure to the risk–return characteristics of a wider range of underlying assets. Note that in many countries, the sale of ABS and similar instruments is restricted to investors who meet certain qualifications, such as those pertaining to net worth. Securitization allows for the creation of tradable securities with better liquidity than that of the original loans on the bank’s balance sheet. In making loans and receivables tradable, securitization makes financial markets more efficient. It also improves liquidity, which reduces liquidity risk in the financial system, as described later. An important benefit of securitization for companies is that ABS provide an alternative means of funding operations that can be considered alongside bond, preferred equity, and common equity issuance. Companies that originate loans and receivables that can be securitized often compare and optimize the funding costs associated with each source of financing. As we will see, securitization is often less costly than a corporate bond issue secured by the same collateral. For these reasons, securitization is beneficial to economies and financial markets and has been embraced by many sovereign governments. For example, the Italian government has used securitization since the late 1990s for privatizing public assets. In emerging markets, securitization is widely used. For example, in South America, companies and banks with high credit ratings have used securitization to sell receivables on exports, such as oil, to lower their funding costs. Although securitization brings many benefits to economies, it is not without risks, and some of these risks are widely attributed to have precipitated the turmoil in financial markets during 2007–2009. Broadly, those risks fall into two categories: risks that relate primarily to the timing of the ABS’s cash flows, such as contraction risk and extension risk, and risks related to the inherent credit risk of the loans and receivables backing the ABS. This reading describes these risks and discusses some of the structures used to mitigate them as well as redistribute them.  ","explain benefits of securitization for economies and financial markets;

"Organizing, Visualizing, and Describing Data",Quantitative Methods,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Data have always been a key input for securities analysis and investment management, but the acceleration in the availability and the quantity of data has also been driving the rapid evolution of the investment industry.With the rise of big data and machine learning techniques, investment practitioners are embracing an era featuring large volume, high velocity, and a wide variety of data. This Refresher Reading invites you to explore and exploit this abundance of information for your investment strategies. While this data-rich environment offers potentially tremendous opportunities for investors, turning data into useful information is not so straightforward. Organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data are crucial to the development of successful investment strategies; otherwise, we end up with “garbage in and garbage out” and failed investments. It is often said that 80% of an analyst’s time is spent on finding, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data, while just 20% of her/his time is taken up by model development. So, the importance of having a properly organized, cleansed, and well-analyzed dataset cannot be over-emphasized. With this essential requirement met, an appropriately executed data analysis can detect important relationships within data, uncover underlying structures, identify outliers, and extract potentially valuable insights. Utilizing both visual tools and quantitative methods, like the ones covered in this reading, is the first step in summarizing and understanding data that will be crucial inputs to an investment strategy. This reading provides a foundation for understanding important concepts that are an indispensable part of the analytical tool kit needed by investment practitioners, from junior analysts to senior portfolio managers. These basic concepts pave the way for more sophisticated tools that will be developed as the quantitative methods topic unfolds and that are integral to gaining competencies in the investment management techniques and asset classes that are presented later in the CFA curriculum. Section 2 covers core data types, including continuous and discrete numerical data, nominal and ordinal categorical data, and structured versus unstructured data. Organizing data into arrays and data tables and summarizing data in frequency distributions and contingency tables are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 introduces the important topic of data visualization using a range of charts and graphics to summarize, explore, and better understand data. Section 5 covers the key measures of central tendency, including several variants of mean that are especially useful in investments. Quantiles and their investment applications are the focus of Section 6. Key measures of dispersion are discussed in Section 7. The shape of data distributions—specifically, skewness and kurtosis—are covered in Sections 8 and 9, respectively. Section 10 provides a graphical introduction to covariance and correlation between two variables. The reading concludes with a Summary.  ","Identify and compare data types;

Market Efficiency,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Market efficiency concerns the extent to which market prices incorporate available
information. If market prices do not fully incorporate information, then opportunities
may exist to make a profit from the gathering and processing of information. The subject
of market efficiency is, therefore, of great interest to investment managers, as illustrated
in Example 1. Governments and market regulators also care about the extent to which market prices
incorporate information. Efficient markets imply informative prices—prices that accurately
reflect available information about fundamental values. In market-based economies,
market prices help determine which companies (and which projects) obtain capital.
If these prices do not efficiently incorporate information about a company’s prospects,
then it is possible that funds will be misdirected. By contrast, prices that are informative
help direct scarce resources and funds available for investment to their highest-valued
uses.
Informative prices thus promote economic growth. The efficiency of a country’s capital
markets (in which businesses raise financing) is an important characteristic of a
well-functioning financial system. The remainder of this reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides specifics
on how the efficiency of an asset market is described and discusses the factors affecting
(i.e., contributing to and impeding) market efficiency. Section 3 presents an influential
three-way classification of the efficiency of security markets and discusses its implications
for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and portfolio management. Section 4
presents several market anomalies (apparent market inefficiencies that have received
enough attention to be individually identified and named) and describes how these
anomalies relate to investment strategies. Section 5 introduces behavioral finance
and how that field of study relates to market efficiency. A summary concludes the
reading.  ","describe market efficiency and related concepts, including their importance to investment

Long-Lived Assets,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Long-lived assets, also referred to as non-current assets or long-term assets, are assets that are
               expected to provide economic benefits over a future period of time, typically greater
               than one year.
                Long-lived assets may be tangible, intangible, or financial assets. Examples of long-lived
               tangible assets, typically referred to asand sometimes as fixed assets, include land, buildings, furniture and fixtures, machinery
               and equipment, and vehicles; examples of long-lived(assets lacking physical substance) include patents and trademarks; and examples
               of long-lived financial assets include investments in equity or debt securities issued
               by other entities. The scope of this reading is limited to long-lived tangible and
               intangible assets (hereafter, referred to for simplicity as long-lived assets). The first issue in accounting for a long-lived asset is determining its cost at acquisition.
               The second issue is how to allocate the cost to expense over time. The costs of most
               long-lived assets are capitalised and then allocated as expenses in the profit or
               loss (income) statement over the period of time during which they are expected to
               provide economic benefits. The two main types of long-lived assets with costs that
               are typicallynotallocated over time are land, which is not depreciated, and those intangible assets
               with indefinite useful lives. Additional issues that arise are the treatment of subsequent
               costs incurred related to the asset, the use of the cost model versus the revaluation
               model, unexpected declines in the value of the asset, classification of the asset
               with respect to intent (for example, held for use or held for sale), and the derecognition
               of the asset. This reading is organised as follows. Section 2 describes and illustrates accounting
               for the acquisition of long-lived assets, with particular attention to the impact
               of capitalizing versus expensing expenditures. Section 3 describes the allocation
               of the costs of long-lived assets over their useful lives. Section 4 discusses the
               revaluation model that is based on changes in the fair value of an asset. Section
               5 covers the concepts of impairment (unexpected decline in the value of an asset).
               Section 6 describes accounting for the derecognition of long-lived assets. Section
               7 describes financial statement presentation, disclosures, and analysis of long-lived
               assets. Section 8 discusses differences in financial reporting of investment property
               compared with property, plant, and equipment. A summary is followed by practice problems.  ","distinguish between costs that are capitalised and costs that are expensed in the

Market Organization and Structure,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Financial analysts gather and process information to make investment decisions, including
those related to buying and selling assets. Generally, the decisions involve trading
securities, currencies, contracts, commodities, and real assets such as real estate.
Consider several examples: Financial analysts must understand the characteristics of the markets in which their
decisions will be executed. This reading, by examining those markets from the analyst’s
perspective, provides that understanding. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the functions of the financial
system. Section 3 introduces assets that investors, information-motivated traders,
and risk managers use to advance their financial objectives and presents ways practitioners
classify these assets into markets. These assets include such financial instruments
as securities, currencies, and some contracts; certain commodities; and real assets.
Financial analysts must know the distinctive characteristics of these trading assets. Section 4 is an overview of financial intermediaries (entities that facilitate the
functioning of the financial system). Section 5 discusses the positions that can be
obtained while trading assets. You will learn about the benefits and risks of long
and short positions, how these positions can be financed, and how the financing affects
their risks. Section 6 discusses how market participants order trades and how markets
process those orders. These processes must be understood to achieve trading objectives
while controlling transaction costs. Section 7 focuses on describing primary markets. Section 8 describes the structures
of secondary markets in securities. Sections 9 and 10 close the reading with discussions

Income Taxes,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," For those companies reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),
               IAS 12 [Income Taxes] covers accounting for a company's income taxes and the reporting
               of deferred taxes. For those companies reporting under United States generally accepted
               accounting principles (US GAAP), FASB ASC Topic 740 [Income Taxes] is the primary
               source for information on accounting for income taxes. Although IFRS and US GAAP follow
               similar conventions on many income tax issues, there are some key differences that
               will be discussed in the reading. Differences between how and when transactions are recognized for financial reporting
               purposes relative to tax reporting can give rise to differences in tax expense and
               related tax assets and liabilities. To reconcile these differences, companies that
               report under either IFRS or US GAAP create a provision on the balance sheet called
               deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities, depending on the nature of the situation. Deferred tax assets or liabilities usually arise when accounting standards and tax
               authorities recognize the timing of revenues and expenses at different times. Because
               timing differences such as these will eventually reverse over time, they are called
               “temporary differences.” Deferred tax assets represent taxes that have been recognized
               for tax reporting purposes (or often the carrying forward of losses from previous
               periods) but have not yet been recognized on the income statement prepared for financial
               reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities represent tax expense that has appeared
               on the income statement for financial reporting purposes, but has not yet become payable
               under tax regulations. This reading provides a primer on the basics of income tax accounting and reporting.
               The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the differences between taxable
               income and accounting profit. Section 3 explains the determination of tax base, which
               relates to the valuation of assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Section 4 discusses
               several types of timing differences between the recognition of taxable and accounting
               profit. Section 5 examines unused tax losses and tax credits. Section 6 describes
               the recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax. Section 7 discusses the
               disclosure and presentation of income tax information on companies' financial statements
               and illustrates its practical implications for financial analysis. Section 8 provides
               an overview of the similarities and differences for income-tax reporting between IFRS

Understanding Cash Flow Statements,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," The cash flow statement provides information about a company’scash receiptsandcash paymentsduring an accounting period. The cash-based information provided by the cash flow
               statement contrasts with the accrual-based information from the income statement.
               For example, the income statement reflects revenues when earned rather than when cash
               is collected; in contrast, the cash flow statement reflects cash receipts when collected
               as opposed to when the revenue was earned. A reconciliation between reported income
               and cash flows from operating activities provides useful information about when, whether,
               and how a company is able to generate cash from its operating activities. Although
               income is an important measure of the results of a company’s activities, cash flow
               is also essential. As an extreme illustration, a hypothetical company that makes all
               sales on account, without regard to whether it will ever collect its accounts receivable,
               would report healthy sales on its income statement and might well report significant
               income; however, with zero cash inflow, the company would not survive. The cash flow
               statement also provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending cash on the balance
               sheet. In addition to information about cash generated (or, alternatively, cash used) in
               operating activities, the cash flow statement provides information about cash provided
               (or used) in a company’s investing and financing activities. This information allows
               the analyst to answer such questions as: Answers to these questions are important because, in theory, generating cash from
               operations can continue indefinitely, but generating cash from selling assets, for
               example, is possible only as long as there are assets to sell. Similarly, generating
               cash from debt financing is possible only as long as lenders are willing to lend,
               and the lending decision depends on expectations that the company will ultimately
               have adequate cash to repay its obligations. In summary, information about the sources
               and uses of cash helps creditors, investors, and other statement users evaluate the
               company’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. This reading explains how cash flow activities are reflected in a company’s cash flow
               statement. The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the components
               and format of the cash flow statement, including the classification of cash flows
               under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted
               accounting principles (GAAP) and the direct and indirect formats for presenting the
               cash flow statement. Section 3 discusses the linkages of the cash flow statement with
               the income statement and balance sheet and the steps in the preparation of the cash
               flow statement. Section 4 demonstrates the analysis of cash flow statements, including
               the conversion of an indirect cash flow statement to the direct method and how to
               use common-size cash flow analysis, free cash flow measures, and cash flow ratios

Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Financial analysis is the process of examining a company’s performance in the context
               of its industry and economic environment in order to arrive at a decision or recommendation.
               Often, the decisions and recommendations addressed by financial analysts pertain to
               providing capital to companies—specifically, whether to invest in the company’s debt
               or equity securities and at what price. An investor in debt securities is concerned
               about the company’s ability to pay interest and to repay the principal lent. An investor
               in equity securities is an owner with a residual interest in the company and is concerned
               about the company’s ability to pay dividends and the likelihood that its share price
               will increase. Overall, a central focus of financial analysis is evaluating the company’s ability
               to earn a return on its capital that is at least equal to the cost of that capital,
               to profitably grow its operations, and to generate enough cash to meet obligations
               and pursue opportunities. Fundamental financial analysis starts with the information found in a company’s financial
               reports. These financial reports include audited financial statements, additional
               disclosures required by regulatory authorities, and any accompanying (unaudited) commentary
               by management. Basic financial statement analysis—as presented in this reading—provides
               a foundation that enables the analyst to better understand other information gathered
               from research beyond the financial reports. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the scope of financial statement
               analysis. Section 3 describes the sources of information used in financial statement
               analysis, including the primary financial statements (statement of financial position
               or balance sheet, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity,
               and cash flow statement). Section 4 provides a framework for guiding the financial

Currency Exchange Rates,Economics,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Measured by daily turnover, the foreign exchange (FX) market—the market in which currencies are traded against each other—is by far the world’s largest market. Current estimates put daily turnover at approximately USD5.1 trillion for 2016. This is about 10 to 15 times larger than daily turnover in global fixed-income markets and about 50 times larger than global turnover in equities. The FX market is also a truly global market that operates 24 hours a day, each business day. It involves market participants from every time zone connected through electronic communications networks that link players as large as multibillion-dollar investment funds and as small as individuals trading for their own account—all brought together in real time. International trade would be impossible without the trade in currencies that facilitates it, and so too would cross-border capital flows that connect all financial markets globally through the FX market. These factors make foreign exchange a key market for investors and market participants to understand. The world economy is increasingly transnational in nature, with both production processes and trade flows often determined more by global factors than by domestic considerations. Likewise, investment portfolio performance increasingly reflects global determinants because pricing in financial markets responds to the array of investment opportunities available worldwide, not just locally. All of these factors funnel through, and are reflected in, the foreign exchange market. As investors shed their “home bias” and invest in foreign markets, the exchange rate—the price at which foreign-currency-denominated investments are valued in terms of the domestic currency—becomes an increasingly important determinant of portfolio performance. Even investors adhering to a purely “domestic” portfolio mandate are increasingly affected by what happens in the foreign exchange market. Given the globalization of the world economy, most large companies depend heavily on their foreign operations (for example, by some estimates about 30 percent of S&P 500 Index earnings are from outside the United States). Almost all companies are exposed to some degree of foreign competition, and the pricing for domestic assets—equities, bonds, real estate, and others—will also depend on demand from foreign investors. All of these various influences on investment performance reflect developments in the foreign exchange market. This reading introduces the foreign exchange market, providing the basic concepts and terminology necessary to understand exchange rates as well as some of the basics of exchange rate economics. The reading is divided up as follows. Section 2 describes the organization of the foreign exchange market and discusses the major players—who they are, how they conduct their business, and how they respond to exchange rate changes. Section 3 takes up the mechanics of exchange rates: definitions, quotes, and calculations. This section shows that the reader has to pay close attention to conventions used in various foreign exchange markets around the world because they can vary widely. Sometimes exchange rates are quoted in the number of domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, and sometimes they are quoted in the opposite way. The exact notation used to represent exchange rates can vary widely as well, and occasionally the same exchange rate notation will be used by different sources to mean completely different things. The notation used here may not be the same as that encountered elsewhere. Therefore, the focus should be on understanding the underlying concepts rather than relying on rote memorization of formulas. We also show how to calculate cross-exchange rates and how to compute the forward exchange rate given either the forward points or the percentage forward premium or discount. In Section 4, we discuss alternative exchange rate regimes operating throughout the world. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss how exchange rates affect a country’s international trade (exports and imports) and capital flows. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.

Understanding Fixed-Income Risk and Return,Fixed Income,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Successful analysts must develop a solid understanding of the risk and return characteristics of fixed-income investments. Beyond the vast global market for public and private fixed-rate bonds, many financial assets and liabilities with known future cash flows you will encounter throughout your career are evaluated using similar principles. This analysis starts with the yield-to-maturity, or internal rate of return on future cash flows, introduced in the fixed-income valuation reading. Fixed-rate bond returns are affected by many factors, the most important of which is the full receipt of all interest and principal payments on scheduled dates. Assuming no default, return is also affected by interest rate changes that affect coupon reinvestment and the bond price if it is sold prior to maturity. Price change measures may be derived from the mathematical relationship used to calculate a bond’s price. Specifically, duration estimates the price change for a given change in interest rates, and convexity improves on the duration estimate by considering that the price and yield-to-maturity relationship of a fixed-rate bond is non-linear. Sources of return on a fixed-rate bond investment include the receipt and reinvestment of coupon payments and either the redemption of principal if the bond is held to maturity or capital gains (or losses) if the bond is sold earlier. Fixed-income investors holding the same bond may have different interest rate risk exposures if their investment horizons differ. We introduce bond duration and convexity, showing how these statistics are calculated and used as interest rate risk measures. Although procedures and formulas exist to calculate duration and convexity, these statistics can be approximated using basic bond-pricing techniques and a financial calculator. Commonly used versions of the statistics are covered, including Macaulay, modified, effective, and key rate durations, and we distinguish between risk measures based on changes in the bond’s yield-to-maturity (i.e., yield duration and convexity) and on benchmark yield curve changes (i.e., curve duration and convexity). We then return to the investment time horizon. When an investor has a short-term horizon, duration and convexity are used to estimate the change in the bond price. Note that yield volatility matters, because bonds with varying times-to-maturity have different degrees of yield volatility. When an investor has a long-term horizon, the interaction between coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk matters. The relationship among interest rate risk, bond duration, and the investment horizon is explored. Finally, we discuss how duration and convexity may be extended to credit and liquidity risks and highlight how these factors can affect a bond’s return and risk. In addition, we highlight the use of statistical methods and historical data to establish empirical as opposed to analytical duration estimates.

Equity Valuation: Concepts and Basic Tools,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Analysts gather and process information to make investment decisions, including buy
and sell recommendations. What information is gathered and how it is processed depend
on the analyst and the purpose of the analysis. Technical analysis uses such information
as stock price and trading volume as the basis for investment decisions. Fundamental
analysis uses information about the economy, industry, and company as the basis for
investment decisions. Examples of fundamentals are unemployment rates, gross domestic
product (GDP) growth, industry growth, and quality of and growth in company earnings.
Whereas technical analysts use information to predict price movements and base investment
decisions on the direction of predicted change in prices, fundamental analysts use
information to estimate the value of a security and to compare the estimated value
to the market price and then base investment decisions on that comparison. This reading introduces equity valuation models used to estimate theintrinsic value(synonym:fundamental value) of a security; intrinsic value is based on an analysis of investment fundamentals
and characteristics. The fundamentals to be considered depend on the analyst’s approach
to valuation. In a top-down approach, an analyst examines the economic environment,
identifies sectors that are expected to prosper in that environment, and analyzes
securities of companies from previously identified attractive sectors. In a bottom-up
approach, an analyst typically follows an industry or industries and forecasts fundamentals
for the companies in those industries in order to determine valuation. Whatever the
approach, an analyst who estimates the intrinsic value of an equity security is implicitly
questioning the accuracy of the market price as an estimate of value. Valuation is
particularly important in active equity portfolio management, which aims to improve
on the return–risk trade-off of a portfolio’s benchmark by identifying mispriced securities. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the implications of differences
between estimated value and market price. Section 3 introduces three major categories
of valuation model. Section 4 presents an overview of present value models with a
focus on the dividend discount model. Section 5 describes and examines the use of
multiples in valuation. Section 6 explains asset-based valuation and demonstrates
how these models can be used to estimate value. Section 7 states conclusions and summarizes

Measures of Leverage,Corporate Finance,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," This reading presents elementary topics in leverage.Leverageis the use of fixed costs in a company’s cost structure. Fixed costs that are operating costs (such as depreciation or rent) create operating leverage. Fixed costs that are financial costs (such as interest expense) create financial leverage. Analysts refer to the use of fixed costs as leverage because fixed costs act as a fulcrum for the company’s earnings. Leverage can magnify earnings both up and down. The profits of highly leveraged companies might soar with small upturns in revenue. But the reverse is also true: Small downturns in revenue may lead to losses. Analysts need to understand a company’s use of leverage for three main reasons. First, the degree of leverage is an important component in assessing a company’s risk and return characteristics. Second, analysts may be able to discern information about a company’s business and future prospects from management’s decisions about the use of operating and financial leverage. Knowing how to interpret these signals also helps the analyst evaluate the quality of management’s decisions. Third, the valuation of a company requires forecasting future cash flows and assessing the risk associated with those cash flows. Understanding a company’s use of leverage should help in forecasting cash flows and in selecting an appropriate discount rate for finding their present value. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces leverage and defines important terms. Section 3 illustrates and discusses measures of operating leverage and financial leverage, which combine to define a measure of total leverage that gauges the sensitivity of net income to a given percent change in units sold. This section also covers breakeven points in using leverage and corporate reorganization (a possible consequence of using leverage inappropriately). A summary and practice problems conclude this reading.  ","define and explain leverage, business risk, sales risk, operating risk, and financial risk and classify a risk;

Inventories,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Merchandising and manufacturing companies generate revenues and profits through the
               sale of inventory. Further, inventory may represent a significant asset on these companies’
               balance sheets. Merchandisers (wholesalers and retailers) purchase inventory, ready
               for sale, from manufacturers and thus account for only one type of inventory—finished
               goods inventory. Manufacturers, however, purchase raw materials from suppliers and
               then add value by transforming the raw materials into finished goods. They typically
               classify inventory into three different categories:
                raw materials, work in progress,
                and finished goods. Work-in-progress inventories have started the conversion process
               from raw materials but are not yet finished goods ready for sale. Manufacturers may
               report either the separate carrying amounts of their raw materials, work-in-progress,
               and finished goods inventories on the balance sheet or simply the total inventory
               amount. If the latter approach is used, the company must then disclose the carrying
               amounts of its raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods inventories in
               a footnote to the financial statements. Inventories and cost of sales (cost of goods sold)
                are significant items in the financial statements of many companies. Comparing the
               performance of these companies is challenging because of the allowable choices for
               valuing inventories: Differences in the choice of inventory valuation method can result
               in significantly different amounts being assigned to inventory and cost of sales.
               Financial statement analysis would be much easier if all companies used the same inventory
               valuation method or if inventory price levels remained constant over time. If there
               was no inflation or deflation with respect to inventory costs and thus unit costs
               were unchanged, the choice of inventory valuation method would be irrelevant. However,
               inventory price levels typically do change over time. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) permit the assignment of inventory
               costs (costs of goods available for sale) to inventories and cost of sales by three
               cost formulas: specific identification, first-in, first-out (FIFO), and weighted average
               cost.
                US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) allow the same three inventory
               valuation methods, referred to as cost flow assumptions in US GAAP, but also include
               a fourth method called last-in, first-out (LIFO).
                The choice of inventory valuation method affects the allocation of the cost of goods
               available for sale to ending inventory and cost of sales. Analysts must understand
               the various inventory valuation methods and the related impact on financial statements
               and financial ratios in order to evaluate a company’s performance over time and relative
               to industry peers. The company’s financial statements and related notes provide important
               information that the analyst can use in assessing the impact of the choice of inventory
               valuation method on financial statements and financial ratios. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the costs that are included
               in inventory and the costs that are recognised as expenses in the period in which
               they are incurred. Section 3 describes inventory valuation methods and compares the
               measurement of ending inventory, cost of sales and gross profit under each method,
               and when using periodic versus perpetual inventory systems. Section 4 describes the
               LIFO method, LIFO reserve, and effects of LIFO liquidations, and demonstrates the
               adjustments required to compare a company that uses LIFO with one that uses FIFO.
               Section 5 describes the financial statement effects of a change in inventory valuation
               method. Section 6 discusses the measurement and reporting of inventory when its value
               changes. Section 7 describes the presentation of inventories on the financial statements
               and related disclosures, discusses inventory ratios and their interpretation, and
               shows examples of financial analysis with respect to inventories. A summary and practice

Security Market Indexes,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Investors gather and analyze vast amounts of information about security markets on
a continual basis. Because this work can be both time consuming and data intensive,
investors often use a single measure that consolidates this information and reflects
the performance of an entire security market. Security market indexes were first introduced as a simple measure to reflect the performance
of the US stock market. Since then, security market indexes have evolved into important
multi-purpose tools that help investors track the performance of various security
markets, estimate risk, and evaluate the performance of investment managers. They
also form the basis for new investment products. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 defines a security market index and
explains how to calculate the price return and total return of an index for a single
period and over multiple periods. Section 3 describes how indexes are constructed
and managed. Section 4 discusses the use of market indexes. Sections 5, 6, and 7 discuss

Overview of Equity Securities,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Equity securities represent ownership claims on a company’s net assets. As an asset
               class, equity plays a fundamental role in investment analysis and portfolio management
               because it represents a significant portion of many individual and institutional investment
               portfolios. The study of equity securities is important for many reasons. First, the decision
               on how much of a client’s portfolio to allocate to equities affects the risk and return
               characteristics of the entire portfolio. Second, different types of equity securities
               have different ownership claims on a company’s net assets, which affect their risk
               and return characteristics in different ways. Finally, variations in the features
               of equity securities are reflected in their market prices, so it is important to understand
               the valuation implications of these features. This reading provides an overview of equity securities and their different features
               and establishes the background required to analyze and value equity securities in
               a global context. It addresses the following questions: The remainder of this reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview
               of global equity markets and their historical performance. Section 3 examines the
               different types and characteristics of equity securities, and Section 4 outlines the

               of the various types of equity securities listed and traded in global markets. Section
               6 discusses the risk and return characteristics of equity securities. Section 7 examines
               the role of equity securities in creating company value and the relationship between

Introduction to Industry and Company Analysis,Equity Investments,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Understanding how industries and companies operate, together with an analysis of financial statements, provides a basis for forecasting company performance and allows analysts to determine the value of an investment in a company or its securities. Industry analysis is the analysis of a specific branch of manufacturing, service, or trade. Understanding the industry in which a company operates provides an essential framework for the analysis of the individual company—that is, company analysis. Equity analysis and credit analysis are often conducted by analysts who concentrate on one or several industries, which results in synergies and efficiencies in gathering and interpreting information. In this reading, we will address the following questions:  ","explain uses of industry analysis and the relation of industry analysis to company analysis;

Cost of Capital,Corporate Finance,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," A company grows by making investments that are expected to increase revenues and profits. It acquires the capital or funds necessary to make such investments by borrowing (i.e., using debt financing) or by using funds from the owners (i.e., equity financing). By applying this capital to investments with long-term benefits, the company is producing value today. How much value? The answer depends not only on the investments’ expected future cash flows but also on the cost of the funds. Borrowing is not costless, nor is using owners’ funds. The cost of this capital is an important ingredient in both investment decision making by the company’s management and the valuation of the company by investors. If a company invests in projects that produce a return in excess of the cost of capital, the company has created value; in contrast, if the company invests in projects whose returns are less than the cost of capital, the company has destroyed value. Therefore, the estimation of the cost of capital is a central issue in corporate financial management and for an analyst seeking to evaluate a company’s investment program and its competitive position. Cost of capital estimation is a challenging task. As we have already implied, the cost of capital is not observable but, rather, must be estimated. Arriving at a cost of capital estimate requires a multitude of assumptions and estimates. Another challenge is that the cost of capital that is appropriately applied to a specific investment depends on the characteristics of that investment: The riskier the investment’s cash flows, the greater its cost of capital. In reality, a company must estimate project-specific costs of capital. What is often done, however, is to estimate the cost of capital for the company as a whole and then adjust this overall corporate cost of capital upward or downward to reflect the risk of the contemplated project relative to the company’s average project. This reading is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the cost of capital and its basic computation. Section 3 presents a selection of methods for estimating the costs of the various sources of capital: debt, preferred stock, and common equity. For the latter, two approaches for estimating the equity risk premium are mentioned. Section 4 discusses beta estimation, a key input in using the CAPM to calculate the cost of equity, and Section 5 examines the correct treatment of flotation, or capital issuance, costs. Section 6 highlights methods used by corporations, and a summary concludes the reading.  ","calculate and interpret the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of a company;

Financial Analysis Techniques,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Financial analysis tools can be useful in assessing a company’s performance and trends
               in that performance. In essence, an analyst converts data into financial metrics that
               assist in decision making. Analysts seek to answer such questions as: How successfully
               has the company performed, relative to its own past performance and relative to its
               competitors? How is the company likely to perform in the future? Based on expectations
               about future performance, what is the value of this company or the securities it issues? A primary source of data is a company’s annual report, including the financial statements
               and notes, and management commentary (operating and financial review or management’s
               discussion and analysis). This reading focuses on data presented in financial reports
               prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and United States
               generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). However, financial reports do
               not contain all the information needed to perform effective financial analysis. Although
               financial statements do contain data about thepastperformance of a company (its income and cash flows) as well as itscurrentfinancial condition (assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity), such statements do
               not necessarily provide all the information useful for analysis nor do they forecastfutureresults. The financial analyst must be capable of using financial statements in conjunction
               with other information to make projections and reach valid conclusions. Accordingly,
               an analyst typically needs to supplement the information found in a company’s financial
               reports with other information, including information on the economy, industry, comparable
               companies, and the company itself. This reading describes various techniques used to analyze a company’s financial statements.
               Financial analysis of a company may be performed for a variety of reasons, such as
               valuing equity securities, assessing credit risk, conducting due diligence related
               to an acquisition, or assessing a subsidiary’s performance. This reading will describe
               techniques common to any financial analysis and then discuss more specific aspects
               for the two most common categories: equity analysis and credit analysis. Equity analysis incorporates an owner’s perspective, either for valuation or performance
               evaluation. Credit analysis incorporates a creditor’s (such as a banker or bondholder)
               perspective. In either case, there is a need to gather and analyze information to
               make a decision (ownership or credit); the focus of analysis varies because of the
               differing interest of owners and creditors. Both equity and credit analyses assess
               the entity’s ability to generate and grow earnings, and cash flow, as well as any
               associated risks. Equity analysis usually places a greater emphasis on growth, whereas
               credit analysis usually places a greater emphasis on risks. The difference in emphasis
               reflects the different fundamentals of these types of investments: The value of a
               company’s equity generally increases as the company’s earnings and cash flow increase,
               whereas the value of a company’s debt has an upper limit. The balance of this reading is organized as follows: Section 2 recaps the framework
               for financial statements and the place of financial analysis techniques within the
               framework. Section 3 provides a description of analytical tools and techniques. Section
               4 explains how to compute, analyze, and interpret common financial ratios. Sections
               5 through 8 explain the use of ratios and other analytical data in equity analysis,
               credit analysis, segment analysis, and forecasting, respectively. A summary of the

Monetary and Fiscal Policy,Economics,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," The economic decisions of households can have a significant impact on an economy. For example, a decision on the part of households to consume more and to save less can lead to an increase in employment, investment, and ultimately profits. Equally, the investment decisions made by corporations can have an important impact on the real economy and on corporate profits. But individual corporations can rarely affect large economies on their own; the decisions of a single household concerning consumption will have a negligible impact on the wider economy. By contrast, the decisions made by governments can have an enormous impact on even the largest and most developed of economies for two main reasons. First, the public sectors of most developed economies normally employ a significant proportion of the population, and they are usually responsible for a significant proportion of spending in an economy. Second, governments are also the largest borrowers in world debt markets. Government policy is ultimately expressed through its borrowing and spending activities. In this reading, we identify and discuss two types of government policy that can affect the macroeconomy and financial markets: monetary policy and fiscal policy. Monetary policyrefers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast,fiscal policyrefers to the government’s decisions about taxation and spending. Both monetary and fiscal policies are used to regulate economic activity over time. They can be used to accelerate growth when an economy starts to slow or to moderate growth and activity when an economy starts to overheat. In addition, fiscal policy can be used to redistribute income and wealth. The overarching goal of both monetary and fiscal policy is normally the creation of an economic environment where growth is stable and positive and inflation is stable and low. Crucially, the aim is therefore to steer the underlying economy so that it does not experience economic booms that may be followed by extended periods of low or negative growth and high levels of unemployment. In such a stable economic environment, householders can feel secure in their consumption and saving decisions, while corporations can concentrate on their investment decisions, on making their regular coupon payments to their bond holders and on making profits for their shareholders. The challenges to achieving this overarching goal are many. Not only are economies frequently buffeted by shocks (such as oil price jumps), but some economists believe that natural cycles in the economy also exist. Moreover, there are plenty of examples from history where government policies—either monetary, fiscal, or both—have exacerbated an economic expansion that eventually led to damaging consequences for the real economy, for financial markets, and for investors. The balance of the reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an introduction to monetary policy and related topics. Section 3 presents fiscal policy. The interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy are the subject of Section 4. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.  ","compare monetary and fiscal policy;

Financial Reporting Quality,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Ideally, analysts would always have access to financial reports that are based on
sound financial reporting standards, such as those from the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and are
free from manipulation. But, in practice, the quality of financial reports can vary
greatly. High-quality financial reporting provides information that is useful to analysts
in assessing a company’s performance and prospects. Low-quality financial reporting
contains inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete information. Extreme lapses in financial reporting quality have given rise to high-profile scandals
that resulted not only in investor losses but also in reduced confidence in the financial
system. Financial statement users who were able to accurately assess financial reporting
quality were better positioned to avoid losses. These lapses illustrate the challenges
analysts face as well as the potential costs of failing to recognize practices that
result in misleading or inaccurate financial reports.Examples of misreporting can provide an analyst with insight into various signals
that may indicate poor-quality financial reports. This reading addressesfinancialreporting quality, which pertains to the quality of information in financial reports, including disclosures
in notes. High-quality reporting provides decision-useful information, which is relevant
and faithfully represents the economic reality of the company’s activities during
the reporting period as well as the company’s financial condition at the end of the
period. A separate but interrelated attribute of quality isquality of reported resultsorearnings quality, which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic
activities and the resulting financial condition. The term “earnings quality” is commonly
used in practice and will be used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash
flow, and/or balance sheet items. High-quality earnings result from activities that
a company will likely be able to sustain in the future and provide a sufficient return
on the company’s investment. The concepts of earnings quality and financial reporting
quality are interrelated because a correct assessment of earnings quality is possible
only when there is some basic level of financial reporting quality. Beyond this basic
level, as the quality of reporting increases, the ability of financial statement users
to correctly assess earnings quality and to develop expectations for future performance
arguably also increases. Section 2 provides a conceptual overview of reporting quality. Section 3 discusses
motivations that might cause, and conditions that might enable, management to issue
financial reports that are not high quality and mechanisms that aim to provide discipline
to financial reporting quality. Section 4 describes choices made by management that
can affect financial reporting quality—presentation choices, accounting methods, and
estimates—as well as warning signs of poor-quality financial reporting.  ","distinguish between financial reporting quality and quality of reported results (including

Topics in Demand and Supply Analysis,Economics,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," In a general sense,economicsis the study of production, distribution, and consumption and can be divided into two broad areas of study: macroeconomics and microeconomics.Macroeconomicsdeals with aggregate economic quantities, such as national output and national income, and is rooted inmicroeconomics, which deals with markets and decision making of individual economic units, including consumers and businesses. Microeconomics is a logical starting point for the study of economics. Microeconomics classifies private economic units into two groups: consumers (or households) and firms. These two groups give rise, respectively, to the theory of the consumer and the theory of the firm as two branches of study. Thetheory of the consumerdeals with consumption (the demand for goods and services) by utility-maximizing individuals (i.e., individuals who make decisions that maximize the satisfaction received from present and future consumption). Thetheory of the firmdeals with the supply of goods and services by profit-maximizing firms. It is expected that candidates will be familiar with the basic concepts of demand and supply. This material is covered in detail in the recommended prerequisite readings. In this reading, we will explore how buyers and sellers interact to determine transaction prices and quantities. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the consumer or demand side of the market model, and Section 3 discusses the supply side of the consumer goods market, paying particular attention to the firm’s costs. Section 4 provides a summary of key points in the reading.  ","calculate and interpret price, income, and cross-price elasticities of demand and describe factors that affect each measure;

Understanding Business Cycles,Economics,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," A typical economy’s output of goods and services fluctuates around its longer-term path. We now turn our attention to those recurring, cyclical fluctuations in economic output. Some of the factors that influence short-term changes in the economy—such as changes in population, technology, and capital—are the same as those that affect long-term sustainable economic growth. But forces that cause shifts in aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves—such as expectations, political developments, natural disasters, and fiscal and monetary policy decisions—influence economies particularly in the short run. We first describe a typical business cycle and its phases. While each cycle is different, analysts and investors need to be familiar with the typical cycle phases and what they mean for the expectations and decisions of businesses and households that influence the performance of sectors and companies. These behaviors also impact financial conditions and risk appetite, thus impacting the setting of expectations and choices of portfolio exposures to different investment sectors or styles. In the sections that follow, we describe credit cycles, introduce several theories of business cycles, and explain how different economic schools of thought interpret the business cycle and their recommendations with respect to it. We also discuss variables that demonstrate predictable relationships with the economy, focusing on those whose movements have value in predicting the future course of the economy. We then proceed to explain measures and features of unemployment and inflation.  ","describe the business cycle and its phases;

The Firm and Market Structures,Economics,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," The purpose of this reading is to build an understanding of the importance of market structure. As different market structures result in different sets of choices facing a firm’s decision makers, an understanding of market structure is a powerful tool in analyzing issues such as a firm’s pricing of its products and, more broadly, its potential to increase profitability. In the long run, a firm’s profitability will be determined by the forces associated with the market structure within which it operates. In a highly competitive market, long-run profits will be driven down by the forces of competition. In less competitive markets, large profits are possible even in the long run; in the short run, any outcome is possible. Therefore, understanding the forces behind the market structure will aid the financial analyst in determining firms’ short- and long-term prospects. Section 2 introduces the analysis of market structures. The section addresses questions such as: What determines the degree of competition associated with each market structure? Given the degree of competition associated with each market structure, what decisions are left to the management team developing corporate strategy? How does a chosen pricing and output strategy evolve into specific decisions that affect the profitability of the firm? The answers to these questions are related to the forces of the market structure within which the firm operates. Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 analyze demand, supply, optimal price and output, and factors affecting long-run equilibrium for perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and pure monopoly, respectively. Section 7 reviews techniques for identifying the various forms of market structure. For example, there are accepted measures of market concentration that are used by regulators of financial institutions to judge whether or not a planned merger or acquisition will harm the competitive nature of regional banking markets. Financial analysts should be able to identify the type of market structure a firm is operating within. Each different structure implies a different long-run sustainability of profits. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.  ","describe characteristics of perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and pure monopoly;

International Trade and Capital Flows,Economics,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Global investors must address two fundamentally interrelated questions: where to invest and in what asset classes? Some countries may be attractive from an equity perspective because of their strong economic growth and the profitability of particular domestic sectors or industries. Other countries may be attractive from a fixed income perspective because of their interest rate environment and price stability. To identify markets that are expected to provide attractive investment opportunities, investors must analyze cross-country differences in such factors as expected GDP growth rates, monetary and fiscal policies, trade policies, and competitiveness. From a longer term perspective investors also need to consider such factors as a country’s stage of economic and financial market development, demographics, quality and quantity of physical and human capital (accumulated education and training of workers), and its area(s) of comparative advantage. This reading provides a framework for analyzing a country’s trade and capital flows and their economic implications. International trade can facilitate economic growth by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation, providing access to larger capital and product markets, and facilitating specialization based on comparative advantage. The flow of financial capital (funds available for investment) between countries with excess savings and those where financial capital is scarce can increase liquidity, raise output, and lower the cost of capital. From an investment perspective, it is important to understand the complex and dynamic nature of international trade and capital flows because investment opportunities are increasingly exposed to the forces of global competition for markets, capital, and ideas. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 defines basic terminology used in the reading and describes patterns and trends in international trade and capital flows. It also discusses the benefits of international trade, distinguishes between absolute and comparative advantage, and explains two traditional models of comparative advantage. Section 3 describes trade restrictions and their implications and discusses the motivation for, and advantages of, trade agreements. Section 4 describes the balance of payments and Section 5 discusses the function and objectives of international organizations that facilitate trade.

Introduction to Fixed-Income Valuation,Fixed Income,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Globally, the fixed-income market is a key source of financing for businesses and governments. In fact, the total market value outstanding of corporate and government bonds is significantly larger than that of equity securities. Similarly, the fixed-income market, which is also called the debt market or bond market, represents a significant investing opportunity for institutions as well as individuals. Pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, among others, are major fixed-income investors. Retirees who desire a relatively stable income stream often hold fixed-income securities. Clearly, understanding how to value fixed-income securities is important to investors, issuers, and financial analysts. We focus on the valuation of traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bonds, although other debt securities, such as floating-rate notes and money market instruments, are also covered. We first describe and illustrate basic bond valuation, which includes pricing a bond using a market discount rate for each of the future cash flows and pricing a bond using a series of spot rates. Valuation using spot rates allows for each future cash flow to be discounted at a rate associated with its timing. This valuation methodology for future cash flows has applications well beyond the fixed-income market. Relationships among a bond’s price, coupon rate, maturity, and market discount rate (yield-to-maturity) are also described and illustrated. We then turn our attention to how bond prices and yields are quoted and calculated in practice. When bonds are actively traded, investors can observe the price and calculate various yield measures. However, these yield measures differ by the type of bond. In practice, different measures are used for fixed-rate bonds, floating-rate notes, and money market instruments. We then discuss the maturity or term structure of interest rates,  involving an analysis of yield curves, which illustrates the relationship between yields-to-maturity and times-to-maturity on bonds with otherwise similar characteristics. Lastly, we describe yield spreads, measures of how much additional yield over the benchmark security (usually a government bond) investors expect for bearing additional risk.

"Fixed-Income Markets: Issuance, Trading, and Funding",Fixed Income,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Global fixed-income markets represent the largest subset of financial markets in terms of number of issuances and market capitalization, they bring borrowers and lenders together to allocate capital globally to its most efficient uses. Fixed-income markets include not only publicly traded securities, such as commercial paper, notes, and bonds, but also non-publicly traded loans. Although they usually attract less attention than equity markets, fixed-income markets are more than three times the size of global equity markets. The Institute of International Finance reports that the size of the global debt market surpassed USD 253 trillion in the third quarter of 2019, representing a 322% global debt-to-GDP ratio (1 Institute of International Finance Global Debt Monitor, January 13, 2020). Debt investors and issuers need to understand how fixed-income markets are structured and how they operate. Debt issuers have financing needs that must be met. For example, a government may need to finance an infrastructure project, a new hospital, or a new school. A start-up technology company may require funds beyond its initial seed funding from investors to expand its business and achieve scale. Financial institutions also have funding needs, and they are among the largest issuers of fixed-income securities. Among the questions this reading addresses are the following: We first present an overview of global fixed-income markets and how these markets are classified. We identify the major issuers of and investors in fixed-income securities, present fixed-income indexes, discuss how fixed-income securities are issued in primary markets, and explore how these securities are then traded in secondary markets.

Understanding Balance Sheets,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," The balance sheet provides information on a company’s resources (assets) and its sources
               of capital (equity and liabilities/debt). This information helps an analyst assess
               a company’s ability to pay for its near-term operating needs, meet future debt obligations,
               and make distributions to owners. The basic equation underlying the balance sheet
               is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Analysts should be aware that different types of assets and liabilities may be measured
               differently. For example, some items are measured at historical cost or a variation
               thereof and others at fair value.
                An understanding of the measurement issues will facilitate analysis. The balance
               sheet measurement issues are, of course, closely linked to the revenue and expense
               recognition issues affecting the income statement. Throughout this reading, we describe
               and illustrate some of the linkages between the measurement issues affecting the balance
               sheet and the revenue and expense recognition issues affecting the income statement. This reading is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe and give examples
               of the elements and formats of balance sheets. Section 3 discusses current assets

Non-Current (Long-Term) Liabilities,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," A non-current liability (long-term liability) broadly represents a probable sacrifice of economic benefits in periods generally greater than one year in the future. Common types of non-current liabilities reported in a company’s financial statements include long-term debt (e.g., bonds payable, long-term notes payable), leases, pension liabilities, and deferred tax liabilities. This reading focuses on bonds payable, leases, and pension liabilities. This reading is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces bonds and the accounting for their issuance. Section 3 discusses the recording of interest expense and interest payments as well as the amortisation of discount or premium. Section 4 describes fair value accounting for bonds, an alternative to the amortised cost approach. Section 5 discusses the repayment of principal when bonds are redeemed or reach maturity, which requires derecognition from the financial statements. Section 6 covers debt covenants. Section 7 describes the financial statement presentation and disclosures about debt financings. Section 8 discusses leases, including the benefits of leasing and accounting for leases by both lessees and lessors. Section 9 introduces pension accounting and the resulting non-current liabilities.

Fixed-Income Securities: Defining Elements,Fixed Income,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Fixed-income securities constitute the most prevalent means of raising capital globally based on total market value. These instruments allow governments, companies, and other issuers to borrow from investors, promising future interest payments and the return of principal, which are contractual (legal) obligations of the issuer. Fixed-income securities are the largest source of capital for government, not-for-profit, and other entities that do not issue equity. For private companies, fixed-income investors differ from shareholders in not having ownership rights. Payments of interest and repayment of principal (amount borrowed) are a higher priority claim on the company’s earnings and assets compared with the claim of common shareholders. Since fixed-income claims rank above shareholder claims in the capital structure, a company’s fixed-income securities have, in theory, lower risk than their common shares. Financial analysts who master these and other fixed-income concepts have a distinct edge over their peers for several reasons. First, given the nature of fixed-income cash flows and their preponderance across issuers and regions, these instruments form the basis for risk versus return comparisons both across and within specific jurisdictions. For example, as bonds issued by the US Treasury and other developed market central governments are viewed as having little to no default risk, they serve as building blocks in determining the time value of money for less certain cash flows. Fixed-income securities also fulfill an important role in portfolio management as a prime means by which individual and institutional investors can fund known future obligations, such as tuition payments or retirement obligations. Finally, while the correlation of fixed-income returns with common share returns varies, adding fixed-income securities to portfolios that include common shares can be an effective way of obtaining diversification benefits. Among the questions to be addressed are the following: Note that the terms “fixed-income securities,” “debt securities,” and “bonds” are often used interchangeably by experts and non-experts alike. We will also follow this convention, and where any nuance of meaning is intended, it will be made clear. Moreover, the term “fixed income” is not to be understood literally: Some fixed-income securities have interest payments that change over time.  ","describe basic features of a fixed-income security;

Sampling and Estimation,Quantitative Methods,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Each day, we observe the high, low, and close of stock market indexes from around the world. Indexes such as the S&P 500 Index and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average are samples of stocks. Although the S&P 500 and the Nikkei do not represent the populations of US or Japanese stocks, we view them as valid indicators of the whole population’s behavior. As analysts, we are accustomed to using this sample information to assess how various markets from around the world are performing. Any statistics that we compute with sample information, however, are only estimates of the underlying population parameters. A sample, then, is a subset of the population—a subset studied to infer conclusions about the population itself. We introduce and discusssampling—the process of obtaining a sample. In investments, we continually make use of the mean as a measure of central tendency of random variables, such as return and earnings per share. Even when the probability distribution of the random variable is unknown, we can make probability statements about the population mean using the central limit theorem. We discuss and illustrate this key result. Following that discussion, we turn to statistical estimation. Estimation seeks precise answers to the question “What is this parameter’s value?” The central limit theorem and estimation, the core of the body of methods presented in the sections that follow, may be applied in investment applications. We often interpret the results for the purpose of deciding what works and what does not work in investments.

Probability Concepts,Quantitative Methods,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Investment decisions are made in a risky environment. The tools that allow us to make decisions with consistency and logic in this setting are based on probability concepts. This reading presents the essential probability tools needed to frame and address many real-world problems involving risk. These tools apply to a variety of issues, such as predicting investment manager performance, forecasting financial variables, and pricing bonds so that they fairly compensate bondholders for default risk. Our focus is practical. We explore the concepts that are most important to investment research and practice. Among these are independence, as it relates to the predictability of returns and financial variables; expectation, as analysts continually look to the future in their analyses and decisions; and variability, variance or dispersion around expectation, as a risk concept important in investments. The reader will acquire specific skills and competencies in using these probability concepts to understand risks and returns on investments.  ","define a random variable, an outcome, and an event;

Portfolio Management for Institutional Investors,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Institutional investors are corporations, trusts, or other legal entities that invest
               in financial markets on behalf of groups or individuals, including both current and
               future generations. On a global basis, institutional investors represent more than
               US$70 trillion in investable assets, and, as such, wield significant influence over
               capital markets. The universe of institutional investors includes, but is not limited to, defined benefit
               and defined contribution pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations,
               banks, and insurance companies. Pension plans, which account for approximately US$35
               trillion in investable assets or roughly half of global institutional assets under
               management, include both defined benefit plans, in which the sponsor (employer) assumes
               investment risk, and defined contribution plans, in which the individual makes investment
               decisions and assumes the investment risk. Sovereign wealth funds, which account for
               about US$7 trillion in assets as of the end of 2016, are government-owned investment
               funds that invest in financial and/or real assets. Endowments and foundations, which
               account for approximately US$1.6 trillion in assets, manage assets on behalf of educational
               institutions, hospitals, churches, museums, and other charitable organizations. Banks
               and insurance companies, comprising net financial assets on the order of US$9 trillion,
               are financial intermediaries that balance portfolios of securities, loans, and derivatives
               for the purposes of (i) meeting the claims of depositors, counterparties, policyholders,
               and creditors and (ii) providing adequate returns to their contractual capital holders.
               The universe of institutional investors is comprised of large, complex, and sophisticated
               investors that must contend with a multitude of investment challenges and constraints. There has been an important shift in the asset allocation of institutional investors
               over the last half century. In the 1970s, most pensions and endowments invested almost
               exclusively in domestic, fixed-income instruments. In the 1980s, many institutional
               investors began to invest in equity markets and often pursued a long-term strategic
               allocation of 60% equities/40% fixed income. In the 1990s, investors recognized the
               benefits of diversification and many made their first forays into international equity
               markets. At the turn of the 21st century, many of the world’s largest pension funds
               and endowments further diversified their portfolios and increased investments in alternative
               asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and other alternative
               or illiquid assets. Meanwhile, institutional investors have seen broad shifts in their strategic investment
               behavior. The trend toward Liability Driven Investing (LDI), long a mainstay of banks
               and insurance companies, has taken hold among many defined benefit pension plans,
               particularly US corporate and public pension funds. Sovereign wealth funds have amassed
               significant assets over the past several decades, and many have implemented innovative
               investment approaches characterized by active management. Many endowments have adopted
               the “Endowment Model” of investing that involves significant exposure to alternative
               investments. Meanwhile, banks and insurers must navigate a complex and ever-changing
               economic and regulatory environment. In this reading, we endeavor to put the numerous factors that affect investment by
               institutional investors into context. Section 2 discusses common characteristics of
               institutional investors as a group. Section 3 provides an overview of investment policies
               for institutional investors. Detailed coverage by institutional investor type begins
               with Section 4, pension funds, where we discuss various factors that influence investments,
               including: stakeholders, liability streams, investment horizons, and liquidity needs;
               major legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax constraints; investment objectives and
               key components of Investment Policy Statements; and, finally, asset allocation and
               investment portfolios that emanate from the foregoing factors and constraints. Section
               5 follows the same approach for sovereign wealth funds, and Section 6 does the same
               for university endowments and private foundations. Section 7 covers banks and insurers
               and includes balance sheet management considerations. A summary of key points concludes

Overview of Private Wealth Management,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Private wealth management refers to investment management and financial planning for
individual investors. The private wealth sector has grown considerably as global wealth
has increased and as individuals have taken on more of the responsibility for managing
their own financial resources. Private wealth managers can help individual investors
seek the benefits as well as navigate the complexities of financial markets. This reading introduces candidates to the process of designing and executing an investment
plan or strategy for the individual investor. We discuss the tools and techniques
used by private wealth managers and how the wealth manager interacts with the client
to serve the client’s needs. Section 2 examines the key differences between private
clients and institutional clients. In Section 3, we discuss how the wealth manager
gains an understanding of the client and identifies key attributes of the client’s
financial situation that are relevant to the wealth management process. Section 4
covers investment planning, including capital sufficiency and retirement planning.
Section 5 discusses the investment policy statement, including its various underlying
parts. Section 6 analyzes portfolio construction, portfolio reporting, and portfolio
review. Finally, in Section 7, we discuss the practice of private wealth management,
including ethical considerations for private wealth managers, compliance considerations,
and the various client segments that private wealth managers encounter. Reflecting the variation in industry terms, we use the terms “private wealth managers,”
“wealth managers,” and “advisors” interchangeably.
We also refer to “individual investors” as “private clients” or, simply, “clients.”
In practice, private wealth managers typically operate either independently or as
representatives of organizations, such as wealth management firms, banks, and broker/dealers.  ","contrast private client and institutional client investment concerns;

 Curriculum",Level III," This reading explains the rationale and application of certain provisions of the 2020
               edition of the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) for Firms. The 2020 edition of the GIPS standards contains three chapters: the GIPS
               Standards for Firms, the GIPS Standards for Asset Owners, and the GIPS Standards for
               Verifiers, each with its own glossary.Candidates are responsible not only for the material contained directly in this reading

               They meet the need for globally accepted standards for investment management firms
               in calculating and presenting their investment returns toprospective clientsandprospectiveinvestors. (In the context of the GIPS Standards for Firms, a prospectiveclientis any person or entity that has expressed interest in one of the firm’s strategies
               and qualifies to invest in that strategy via a segregated account, irrespective of
               whether the person or entity currently invests with the firm through another strategy
               that the firm offers. A prospectiveinvestoris any person or entity that has expressed interest in one of the firm’s pooled funds
               and qualifies to invest in the pooled fund, again irrespective of any other current
               investments with the firm. These and other terms bolded in this reading are defined
               in the glossary of the GIPS Standards for Firms. For purposes of this reading, the
               termsclientandinvestormay be used interchangeably.) The GIPS standards are based on the ideals of fair representation and full disclosure
               of an investment management firm’s performance history. Firms that claim compliance
               with the GIPS standards must adhere to rules governing not only return calculations
               but also the way in which returns are displayed in aGIPS Report. (A GIPS Report is a specific type of performance presentation that must be provided
               toprospectiveclients and investors when a firm claims compliance with the GIPS standards.) They
               are further required to make certain disclosures and are encouraged to make others
               in a GIPS Report, thereby assisting the user in interpreting and evaluating the reported
               returns. Prospective and current clients can have a high degree of confidence that
               the information shown in a GIPS Report reflects the results of the firm’s past investment
               decisions. They can also be confident that the returns are calculated and presented

Investment Manager Selection,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Most investors do not hold securities directly but rather invest using intermediaries.
Whether the intermediary is a separately managed account or a pooled investment vehicle,
such as mutual funds in the United States, unit trusts in the United Kingdom, Undertakings
for the Collective Investment of Transferable Securities (UCITS) in the European Union,
hedge funds, private equity funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a professional
investment manager is being entrusted with helping investors achieve their investment
objectives. In all of these cases, the selection of appropriate investment managers
is a challenge with important financial consequences. Evaluating an investment manager is a complex and detailed process that encompasses
a great deal more than analyzing investment returns. The investigation and analysis
in support of an investment action, decision, or recommendation is calleddue diligence. In conducting investment manager due diligence, the focus is on understanding how
the investment results were achieved and on assessing the likelihood that the investment
process that generated these returns will produce superior or at least satisfactory
investment results going forward. Due diligence also entails an evaluation of a firm’s
integrity, operations, and personnel. As such, due diligence involves both quantitative
and qualitative analysis. This reading provides a framework that introduces and describes the important elements
of the manager selection process. Although it is important to have a well-defined
methodology, this reading is not intended to be a rigid checklist, a step-by-step
guide, or an in-depth analysis but rather to present a structure from which the reader
can develop their own approach. We assume that the investment policy statement (IPS) has been drafted, the asset allocation
determined, and the decision to use an outside adviser has been made. As a result,
the focus is on determining which manager offers the “best” means to implement or
express those decisions. The discussion has three broad topics: The reading concludes with a summary of selected important points.  ","describe the components of a manager selection process, including due diligence;

Topics in Private Wealth Management,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," This reading focuses on three important areas of technical competency in the management
of private client assets: the impact of taxes on wealth accumulation, the management
of concentrated positions in public or private assets, and basic tools and techniques
for preserving wealth through generations. We begin with a discussion of taxes. Taxes are an important determinant of the taxable
investor’s final returns. While fees and trading costs have received a lot of attention
in the press and academic spheres, the erosion of returns due to taxes can be much
more significant. Consider this scenario: After significant development and testing, your firm has just
launched a new strategy that tactically shifts between different equity indexes. The
backtests show significant alpha over most time horizons and especially strong performance
during market downturns—a risk/return profile that should be highly attractive to
your clients. You launch the strategy 1 January, and everyone is pleased with the
performance in the first year. On 15 February of the following year, the founder of
the firm receives a telephone call from the accountant for Charles and Ivy Lee, an
important private client relationship. The accountant has been compiling the Lees’
tax documents in preparation for filing the annual tax return. It seems that the trading
activity inherent in your new strategy has generated a lot of capital gains, and the
resulting tax bill is larger than the excess returns generated by your strategy! This scenario is not uncommon. Because a significant proportion of actively managed
assets is managed on behalf of tax-exempt institutions, such as retirement plans and
sovereign wealth funds, strategies are often developed either without regard to taxes
or with taxes as an afterthought and then applied—unsuccessfully—to taxable investors. To illustrate the effect of taxes on wealth accumulation, let’s examine a longer time
horizon. The S&P 500 Index from 1 January 1990 through 30 June 2019 appreciated 7.5%
per year, on average. With dividends reinvested and ignoring fees and transaction
costs, the compound annual growth rate would have been 9.8%. If the Lees had invested
$1 million on 1 January 1990, we would expect their portfolio to have grown to $16
million by the end of the nearly 30-year period. However, this is only true if the
assets are not subject to taxation during the accumulation phase, as would be the
case if they are held in a retirement account or a private family foundation. If we assume the worst case, that both dividends and capital gains are taxed fully
at a marginal tax rate of 50%, then the 9.8% compound annual growth rate would be
cut roughly in half—to 5.0%. In other words, their $1 million would have only grown
to $4 million after almost 30 years—only one-fourth of what the tax-exempt account
realized. Clearly, taxes are an important investment consideration. Fortunately, as a tax-aware practitioner, you may be able to use various tax-management
techniques to reduce the tax drag. If capital gains and dividends are taxed at 25%,
the final wealth of the taxable portfolio would have grown to $8 million. If capital
gains taxes can be eliminated or deferred and only dividends are taxed at the 25%
rate, then the $1 million would have grown to $13 million at the end of our horizon.
It is still not as good as the tax-exempt case, but it is significantly better than
our worst case. Broadly speaking, a portfolio manager managing assets for a private client looks to
maximize after-tax returns for a given level of risk. This reading lays the ground
work for understanding how different types of taxes impact wealth accumulation. We
review the general principles of taxation, how to measure tax efficiency, and how
to reduce the impact of taxes on a portfolio. Hopefully we’ve convinced you why it is important to manage your client’s portfolio
with taxes in mind. Tax considerations, however, are just one element of managing
assets for private wealth clients. Suppose that only 50% of your private client’s
assets are invested in your tax-aware investment strategy. The other 50% of assets
are tied up in a company that was the primary source of wealth creation for your client:
Ivy Lee started a business in her early 20s that succeeded far beyond her initial
expectations. While she has accumulated liquid assets outside of that business, a
substantial portion of her net worth is held in company stock. From your earlier readings
in the course of the CFA Program, you realize that this is a very risky position.
Taken in the aggregate, her portfolio is undiversified; however, to sell the position
outright would create an enormous tax liability or lead to a loss of control over
the business she created. How, then, do you help the client achieve her goals? This
reading discusses some practical tools that you can employ to manage the risk of this
concentrated position. Finally, Ivy and Charles want to maximize the likelihood that the strong financial
foundation they have created will survive to provide support for their children’s
and grandchildren’s future endeavors. Ivy has frequently heard the phrase “shirtsleeves
to shirtsleeves in three generations,” meaning that family wealth rarely survives
beyond three generations. Some variation of that saying exists in many cultures. The
Lees want your help to create a structure that will counter that conventional wisdom.
While this reading won’t make you an estate planning expert, it will prepare you to
identify estate planning opportunities that may help the Lees achieve that goal and
to work more effectively with the Lees’ estate planning professionals toward that
end.  ","compare taxation of income, wealth, and wealth transfers;

Risk Management for Individuals,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Risk management for individuals is a key element of life-cycle finance, which recognizes
that as investors age, the fundamental nature of their total wealth evolves, as do
the risks that they face.Life-cycle financeis concerned with helping investors achieve their goals, including an adequate retirement
income, by taking a holistic view of the individual’s financial situation as he or
she moves through life. Individuals are exposed to a range of risks over their lives:
They may become disabled, suffer a prolonged illness, die prematurely, or outlive
their resources. In addition, from an investment perspective, the assets of individuals
could decline in value or provide an inadequate return in relation to financial needs
and aspirations. All of these risks have two things in common: They are typically
random, and they can result in financial hardship without an appropriate risk management
strategy. Risk management for individuals is distinct from risk management for corporations
given the distinctive characteristics of households, which include the finite and
unknown lifespan of individuals, the frequent preference for stable spending among
individuals, and the desire to pass on wealth to heirs (i.e., through bequests). To
protect against unexpected financial hardships, risks must be identified, market and
non-market solutions considered, and a plan developed and implemented. A well-constructed
plan for risk management will involve the selection of financial products and investment
strategies that fit an individual’s financial goals and mitigate the risk of shortfalls. In this reading, we provide an overview of the potential risks to an individual or
household, an analysis of products and strategies that can protect against some of
these risks, and a discussion regarding the selection of an appropriate product or
strategy. Following the introduction, Section 2 provides an overview of human and
financial capital. Section 3 addresses the process of risk management, the financial
stages of life for an individual, the economic (or holistic) balance sheet, and individual
risks and risk exposures. Section 4 discusses the types of products relevant to financial
planning, including insurance and annuities. Section 5 contains an insurance program

Ethics and Trust in the Investment Profession,Ethical and Professional Standards,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," As a candidate in the CFA Program, you are both expected and required to meet high ethical standards. This reading introduces ideas and concepts that will help you understand the importance of ethical behavior in the investment industry. You will be introduced to various types of ethical issues within the investment profession and learn about the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. The readings covering ethics and professional standards demonstrate that ethical behavior is central to creating trust. Professional behavior is equally important. Professions help maintain trust in an industry by establishing codes and setting standards that put a framework around ethical behavior and technical competence. Professions also set the wider goal of gaining and maintaining the trust of society as a whole. In this regard, professions have a sense of purpose that society values. Imagine that you are employed in the research department of a large financial services firm. You and your colleagues spend your days researching, analyzing, and valuing the shares of publicly traded companies and sharing your investment recommendations with clients. You love your work and take great satisfaction in knowing that your recommendations can help the firm’s investing clients make informed investment decisions that will help them meet their financial goals and improve their lives. Several months after starting at the firm, you learn that an analyst at the firm has been terminated for writing and publishing research reports that misrepresented the fundamental risks of some companies to investors. You learn that the analyst wrote the reports with the goal of pleasing the management of the companies that were the subjects of the research reports. He hoped that these companies would hire your firm’s investment banking division for its services and he would be rewarded with large bonuses for helping the firm increase its investment banking fees. Some clients bought shares based on the analyst’s reports and suffered losses. They posted stories on the internet about their losses and the misleading nature of the reports. When the media investigated and published the story, the firm’s reputation for investment research suffered. Investors began to question the firm’s motives and the objectivity of its research recommendations. The firm’s investment clients started to look elsewhere for investment advice, and company clients begin to transfer their business to firms with untarnished reputations. With business declining, management is forced to trim staff. Along with many other hard-working colleagues, you lose your job—through no fault of your own. Imagine how you would feel in this situation. Most people would feel upset and resentful that their hard and honest work was derailed by someone else’s unethical behavior. Yet, this type of scenario is not uncommon. Around the world, unsuspecting employees at such companies as SAC Capital, Stanford Financial Group, Everbright Securities, Enron, Satyam Computer Services, Arthur Andersen, and other large companies have experienced such career setbacks when someone else’s actions destroyed trust in their companies and industries. Businesses and financial markets thrive on trust—defined as a strong belief in the reliability of a person or institution. In a 2016 study on trust, investors indicated that to earn their trust, the top two attributes of an investment manager should be that it (1) has transparent and open business practices, and (2) has ethical business practices. Although these attributes are valued by customers and clients in any industry, this reading will explore why they are of particular importance to the investment industry. People may think that ethical behavior is simply about following laws, regulations, and other rules, but throughout our lives and careers we will encounter situations in which there is no definitive rule that specifies how to act, or the rules that exist may be unclear or even in conflict with each other. Responsible people, including investment professionals, must be willing and able to identify potential ethical issues and create solutions to them even in the absence of clearly stated rules.

Trade Strategy and Execution,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," This reading discusses trading and execution from a portfolio manager’s perspective.
               The reading covers a broad range of topics related to trade strategy selection and
               implementation and trade cost measurement and evaluation. Growth in electronic trading
               has led to increased automation in trading, including the use of algorithmic trading
               and machine learning to optimize trade strategy and execution. Various markets, including
               equities, fixed income, derivatives, and foreign exchange, are examined. Adequate
               trading processes and procedures are also discussed from a regulatory and governance
               perspective. Portfolio managers need to work closely with traders to determine the most appropriate
               trading strategy given their motivation for trading, risk aversion, trade urgency,
               and other factors, such as order characteristics and market conditions. Trade execution
               should be well integrated with the portfolio management process, and although trading
               strategies will vary on the basis of market and security type, all trade activity
               should be evaluated for execution quality and to assess broker and trade venue performance
               consistent with the fund’s objectives. Additionally, firms should have proper documentation
               of trade procedures in place to meet regulatory and governance standards. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses portfolio manager motivations
               to trade. Section 3 discusses inputs to trade strategy selection and the trade strategy
               selection process. Section 4 covers the range of trade implementation choices and
               trading algorithms and provides a comparison of various markets. Section 5 explains
               how trade costs are measured and how to evaluate trade execution. Section 6 provides
               guidance on evaluating a firm’s trading procedures for good governance practices.

Portfolio Performance Evaluation,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Performance evaluation is one of the most critical areas of investment analysis. Performance
               results can be used to assess the quality of the investment approach and suggest changes
               that might improve it. They are also used to communicate the results of the investment
               process to other stakeholders and may even be used to compensate the investment managers.
               Therefore, it is of vital importance that practitioners who use these analyses understand
               how the results are generated. By gaining an understanding of the details of how these
               analyses work, practitioners will develop a greater understanding of the insights
               that might be gathered from the analysis and will also be cognizant of the limitations
               of those approaches, careful not to infer more than what is explicit or logically
               implicit in the results. We will first consider the broad categories of performance measurement, attribution,
               and appraisal, differentiating between the three and explaining their interrelationships.
               Next, we will provide practitioners with tools to evaluate the effectiveness of those
               analyses as we summarize various approaches to performance evaluation. We will cover
               returns-based, holdings-based, and transactions-based attribution, addressing the
               merits and shortcomings of each approach and providing guidance on how to properly
               interpret attribution results. Again, by reviewing how each approach generates its
               results, we reveal strengths and weaknesses of the individual attribution approaches. Next, we will turn to the subject of benchmarks and performance appraisal ratios.
               We will review the long-standing tests of benchmark quality and differentiate market
               indexes from benchmarks. We will also review different ratios used in performance
               appraisal, considering the benefits and limitations of each approach. Lastly, we will provide advice on using these tools to collectively evaluate the skill
               of investment managers. This advice relies heavily on understanding the analysis tools,
               the limitations of the approaches, the importance of data to the quality of the analysis,
               and the pitfalls to avoid when making recommendations.  ","explain the following components of portfolio evaluation and their interrelationships:

Exchange Traded Funds: Mechanics and Applications,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown rapidly since their invention in the early 1990s, in large part because of their low associated cost, exchange access, holdings transparency, and range of asset classes available. Growth in ETFs has also been driven by the increased use of index-based investing. ETF investors need to understand how these products work and trade and how to choose from the numerous options available. Although many ETFs are organized under the same regulation as mutual fund products, there are important differences related to trading and tax efficiency. ETFs have features that can make them more tax efficient than traditional mutual funds, and not all ETFs are organized like mutual funds. ETFs can be based on derivative strategies, use leverage and shorting, and be offered in alternate structures, such as exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which have their own unique risks. Understanding how ETF shares are created and redeemed is key to understanding how these products can add value in a portfolio. Because so many ETFs track indexes, understanding their index tracking or tracking error is also critical. Investors should also understand how to assess an ETF’s trading costs, including differences between the ETF’s market price and the fair value of its portfolio holdings. We start with a discussion of the primary and secondary markets for ETFs, including the creation/redemption process, before moving on to important investor considerations, such as costs and risks. We then explain how ETFs are use in strategic, tactical, and portfolio efficiency applications.

Fixed-Income Active Management: Credit Strategies,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Most fixed-income instruments trade at a nominal yield to maturity (YTM) that lies above that for an equivalent government or benchmark bond of similar maturity. Thisyield spreador difference compensates investors for the risk that they might not receive interest and principal cash flows as expected, whether as a result of a financially distressed corporate borrower, a sovereign issuer unable (or unwilling) to meet scheduled payments, or a deterioration in credit quality in an underlying pool of assets of a structured instrument such as an asset-backed security. A portion of the yield spread reflects the bid–offer cost of buying or selling a particular bond versus a government security, a liquidity premium that varies based on market conditions. Active managers of spread-based fixed-income portfolios take positions in credit and other risk factors that vary from those of an index to generate excess return versus passive index replication. Financial analysts who build on their foundational knowledge by mastering these more advanced fixed-income concepts and tools will broaden their career opportunities in the investment industry. We begin by reviewing expected fixed-income portfolio return components with a particular focus on credit spreads. These spreads are not directly observable but rather derived from market information. Similar to benchmark yield curves, credit-spread curves are often defined by spread level and slope, and usually grouped by credit rating to gauge relative risk as well as to anticipate and act on expected changes in these relationships over the business cycle. We outline credit spread measures for fixed- and floating-rate bonds and quantify the effect of spread changes on portfolio value. Building blocks for active credit management beyond individual bonds include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), structured financial instruments, and derivative products such as credit default swaps (CDS). These tools are used to describe bottom-up and top-down active credit management approaches as well as how managers position spread-based fixed-income portfolios to capitalize on a market view.

Overview of Asset Allocation,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Asset owners are concerned with accumulating and maintaining the wealth needed to
meet their needs and aspirations. In that endeavor, investment portfolios—including
individuals’ portfolios and institutional funds—play important roles. Asset allocation
is a strategic—and often a first or early—decision in portfolio construction. Because
it holds that position, it is widely accepted as important and meriting careful attention.
Among the questions addressed in this reading are the following: The strategic asset allocation decision determines return levels
in which allocations are invested, irrespective of the degree of active management.
Because of its strategic importance, the investment committee, at the highest level
of the governance hierarchy, typically retains approval of the strategic asset allocation
decision. Often a proposal is developed only after a formal asset allocation study
that incorporates obligations, objectives, and constraints; simulates possible investment
outcomes over an agreed-on investment horizon; and evaluates the risk and return characteristics
of the possible allocation strategies. In providing an overview of asset allocation, this reading’s focus is the alignment
of asset allocation with the asset owner’s investment objectives, constraints, and
overall financial condition. This is the first reading in several sequences of readings
that address, respectively, asset allocation and portfolio management of equities,
fixed income, and alternative investments. Asset allocation is also linked to other
facets of portfolio management, including risk management and behavioral finance.
As coverage of asset allocation progresses in the sequence of readings, various connections
to these topics, covered in detail in other areas of the curriculum, will be made. In the asset allocation sequence, the role of this reading is the “big picture.” It
also offers definitions that will provide a coordinated treatment of many later topics
in portfolio management. The second reading provides the basic “how” of developing
an asset allocation, and the third reading explores various common, real-world complexities
in developing an asset allocation. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the importance of asset allocation
in investment management. Section 3 addresses the investment governance context in
which asset allocation decisions are made. Section 4 considers asset allocation from
the comprehensive perspective offered by the asset owner’s economic balance sheet.
Section 5 distinguishes three broad approaches to asset allocation and explains how
they differ in investment objective and risk. In Section 6, these three approaches
are discussed at a high level in relation to three cases. Section 7 provides a top-level
orientation to how a chosen asset allocation may be implemented, providing a set of
definitions that underlie subsequent readings. Section 8 discusses rebalancing considerations,
and Section 9 provides a summary of the reading.  ","describe elements of effective investment governance and investment governance considerations

Principles of Asset Allocation,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Determining a strategic asset allocation is arguably the most important aspect of
the investment process. This reading builds on the “Introduction to Asset Allocation”
reading and focuses on several of the primary frameworks for developing an asset allocation,
including asset-only mean–variance optimization, various liability-relative asset
allocation techniques, and goals-based investing. Additionally, it touches on various
other asset allocation techniques used by practitioners, as well as important related
topics, such as rebalancing. The process of creating a diversified, multi-asset class portfolio typically involves
two separate steps. The first step is the asset allocation decision, which can refer
to both the process and the result of determining long-term (strategic) exposures
to the available asset classes (or risk factors) that make up the investor’s opportunity
set. Asset allocation is the first and primary step in translating the client’s circumstances,
objectives, and constraints into an appropriate portfolio (or, for some approaches,
multiple portfolios) for achieving the client’s goals within the client’s tolerance
for risk. The second step in creating a diversified, multi-asset-class portfolio involves
implementation decisions that determine the specific investments (individual securities,
pooled investment vehicles, and separate accounts) that will be used to implement
the targeted allocations. Although it is possible to carry out the asset allocation process and the implementation
process simultaneously, in practice, these two steps are often separated for two reasons.
First, the frameworks for simultaneously determining an asset allocation and its implementation
are often complex. Second, in practice, many investors prefer to revisit their strategic
asset allocation policy somewhat infrequently (e.g., annually or less frequently)
in a dedicated asset allocation study, while most of these same investors prefer to
revisit/monitor implementation vehicles (actual investments) far more frequently (e.g.,
monthly or quarterly). Section 2 covers the traditional mean–variance optimization (MVO) approach to asset
allocation. We apply this approach in what is referred to as an “asset-only” setting,
in which the goal is to create the most efficient mixes of asset classes in the absence
of any liabilities. We highlight key criticisms of mean–variance optimization and
methods used to address them. This section also covers risk budgeting in relation
to asset allocation, factor-based asset allocation, and asset allocation with illiquid
assets. The observation that almost all portfolios exist to help pay for what can
be characterized as a “liability” leads to the next subject. Section 3 introduces liability-relative asset allocation—including a straightforward
extension of mean–variance optimization known as surplus optimization. Surplus optimization
is an economic balance sheet approach extended to the liability side of the balance
sheet that finds the most efficient asset class mixes in the presence of liabilities.
Liability-relative optimization is simultaneously concerned with the return of the
assets, the change in value of the liabilities, and how assets and liabilities interact
to determine the overall value or health of the total portfolio. Section 4 covers an increasingly popular approach to asset allocation called goals-based
asset allocation. Conceptually, goals-based approaches are similar to liability-relative
asset allocation in viewing risk in relation to specific needs or objectives associated
with different time horizons and degrees of urgency. Section 5 introduces some informal (heuristic) ways that asset allocations have been
determined and other approaches to asset allocation that emphasize specific objectives. Section 6 addresses the factors affecting choices that are made in developing specific
policies relating to rebalancing to the strategic asset allocation. Factors discussed
include transaction costs, correlations, volatility, and risk aversion. Section 7 summarizes important points and concludes the reading.  ","describe and critique the use of mean–variance optimization in asset allocation;

Technical Analysis,EconomicsFinancial Reporting and Analysis,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Technical analysis has been used by traders, analysts, and investors for centuries and has achieved broad acceptance among regulators and the academic community—particularly with regard to its behavioral finance aspects. This reading gives a brief overview of the field, compares technical analysis with other schools of analysis, and describes some of the main tools used in technical analysis. Although technical analysis follows predefined rules and principles, the interpretation of results is generally subjective. That is, although certain aspects, such as the calculation of indicators, follow specific rules, the interpretation of findings is often based on a melding of techniques that suit the style and approach of the individual analyst. In this respect, technical analysis is similar to fundamental analysis, which has specific rules for calculating ratios, for example, but introduces increased subjectivity in the evaluation phase.

Introduction to Risk Management,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Risk—and risk management—is an inescapable part of economic activity. People generally manage their affairs to be as happy and secure as their environment and resources will allow. But regardless of how carefully these affairs are managed, there is risk because the outcome, whether good or bad, is seldom predictable with complete certainty. There is risk inherent in nearly everything we do, but this reading will focus on economic and financial risk, particularly as it relates to investment management. All businesses and investors manage risk, whether consciously or not, in the choices they make. At its core, business and investing are about allocating resources and capital to chosen risks. In their decision process, within an environment of uncertainty, these organizations may take steps to avoid some risks, pursue the risks that provide the highest rewards, and measure and mitigate their exposure to these risks as necessary. Risk management processes and tools make difficult business and financial problems easier to address in an uncertain world. Risk is not just a matter of fate; it is something that organizations can actively manage with their decisions, within a risk management framework. Risk is an integral part of the business or investment process. Even in the earliest models of modern portfolio theory, such as mean–variance portfolio optimization and the capital asset pricing model, investment return is linked directly to risk but requires that risk be managed optimally. Proper identification and measurement of risk, and keeping risks aligned with the goals of the enterprise, are key factors in managing businesses and investments. Good risk management results in a higher chance of a preferred outcome—more value for the company or portfolio or more utility for the individual. Portfolio managers need to be familiar with risk management not only to improve the portfolio’s risk–return outcome, but also because of two other ways in which they use risk management at an enterprise level. First, they help to manage their own companies that have their own enterprise risk issues. Second, many portfolio assets are claims on companies that have risks. Portfolio managers need to evaluate the companies’ risks and how those companies are addressing them. This reading takes a broad approach that addresses both the risk management of enterprises in general and portfolio risk management. The principles underlying portfolio risk management are generally applicable to the risk management of financial and non-financial institutions as well. The concept of risk management is also relevant to individuals. Although many large organizations formally practice risk management, most individuals practice it more informally and some practice it haphazardly, oftentimes responding to risk events after they occur. Although many individuals do take reasonable precautions against unwanted risks, these precautions are often against obvious risks. The more subtle risks are often ignored. Unfortunately, many individuals do not view risk management as a formal, systematic process that would help them achieve not only their financial goals but also the ultimate goal, or maximum utility as economists like to call it, but they should. Although the primary focus of this reading is on institutions, we will also cover risk management as it applies to individuals. We will show that many common themes underlie risk management—themes that are applicable to both organizations and individuals. Although often viewed as defensive, risk management is a valuable offensive weapon in the manager’s arsenal. In the quest for preferred outcomes, such as higher profit, returns, or share price, management does not usually get to choose the outcomes but does choose the risks it takes in pursuit of those outcomes. The choice of which risks to undertake through the allocation of its scarce resources is the key tool available to management. An organization with a comprehensive risk management culture in place, in which risk is integral to every key strategy and decision, should perform better in the long-term, in good times and bad, as a result of better decision making. The fact that all businesses and investors engage in risky activities (i.e., activities with uncertain outcomes) raises a number of important questions. The questions that this reading will address include the following: The answers to these questions collectively help to define the process of risk management. This reading is organized along the lines of these questions. Section 2 describes the risk management process, and Section 3 discusses risk governance and risk tolerance. Section 4 covers the identification of various risks, and Section 5 addresses the measurement and management of risks. Section 6 provides a summary.  ","define risk management;

Portfolio Risk and Return: Part II,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Our objective in this reading is to identify the optimal risky portfolio for all investors by using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The foundation of this reading is the computation of risk and return of a portfolio and the role that correlation plays in diversifying portfolio risk and arriving at the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier and the capital allocation line consist of portfolios that are generally acceptable to all investors. By combining an investor’s individual indifference curves with the market-determined capital allocation line, we are able to illustrate that the only optimal risky portfolio for an investor is the portfolio of all risky assets (i.e., the market). Additionally, we discuss the capital market line, a special case of the capital allocation line that is used for passive investor portfolios. We also differentiate between systematic and nonsystematic risk, and explain why investors are compensated for bearing systematic risk but receive no compensation for bearing nonsystematic risk. We discuss in detail the CAPM, which is a simple model for estimating asset returns based only on the asset’s systematic risk. Finally, we illustrate how the CAPM allows security selection to build an optimal portfolio for an investor by changing the asset mix beyond a passive market portfolio. The reading is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the consequences of combining a risk-free asset with the market portfolio and provide an interpretation of the capital market line. Section 3 decomposes total risk into systematic and nonsystematic risk and discusses the characteristics of and differences between the two kinds of risk. We also introduce return-generating models, including the single-index model, and illustrate the calculation of beta. In Section 4, we introduce the capital asset pricing model and the security market line. Our focus on the CAPM does not suggest that the CAPM is the only viable asset pricing model. Although the CAPM is an excellent starting point, more advanced readings expand on these discussions and extend the analysis to other models that account for multiple explanatory factors. Section 5 covers several post-CAPM developments in theory.  Section 6 covers measures for evaluating the performance of a portfolio which take account of risk.  Section 7 covers some applications of the CAPM in portfolio construction. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.

Portfolio Risk and Return: Part I,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Construction of an optimal portfolio is an important objective for an investor. In this reading, we will explore the process of examining the risk and return characteristics of individual assets, creating all possible portfolios, selecting the most efficient portfolios, and ultimately choosing the optimal portfolio tailored to the individual in question. During the process of constructing the optimal portfolio, several factors and investment characteristics are considered. The most important of those factors are risk and return of the individual assets under consideration. Correlations among individual assets along with risk and return are important determinants of portfolio risk. Creating a portfolio for an investor requires an understanding of the risk profile of the investor. Although we will not discuss the process of determining risk aversion for individuals or institutional investors, it is necessary to obtain such information for making an informed decision. In this reading, we will explain the broad types of investors and how their risk–return preferences can be formalized to select the optimal portfolio from among the infinite portfolios contained in the investment opportunity set. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the investment characteristics of assets. In particular, we show the various types of returns and risks, their computation and their applicability to the selection of appropriate assets for inclusion in a portfolio. Section 3 discusses risk aversion and how indifference curves, which incorporate individual preferences, can be constructed. The indifference curves are then applied to the selection of an optimal portfolio using two risky assets. Section 4 provides an understanding and computation of portfolio risk. The role of correlation and diversification of portfolio risk are examined in detail. Section 5 begins with the risky assets available to investors and constructs a large number of risky portfolios. It illustrates the process of narrowing the choices to an efficient set of risky portfolios before identifying the optimal risky portfolio. The risky portfolio is combined with investor risk preferences to generate the investor’s optimal portfolio. A summary concludes this reading.

Economics and Investment Markets,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," The state of the economy and financial market activity are interconnected. Financial
               markets are the forums where savers are connected with investors. This activity enables
               savers to defer consumption today for consumption in the future, allows governments
               to raise the capital necessary to create a secure society, and permits corporations
               to access capital to exploit profitable investment opportunities, which, in turn,
               should help to generate future economic growth and employment. Furthermore, all financial
               instruments essentially represent claims on an underlying economy. There is, therefore,
               an important and fundamental connection that runs from the decisions of economic agents,
               as they plan their present and future consumption, to the prices of financial instruments,
               such as bonds and equities. The purpose of this reading is to identify and explain the links between the real
               economy and financial markets and to show how economic analysis can be used to develop
               ways of valuing both individual financial market securities and aggregations of these
               securities, such as financial market indexes. We begin by reviewing what we refer
               to as the fundamental pricing equation for all financial instruments. Using this framework,
               we then move on to explore the relationship between the economy and real default-free
               debt. From there, we can extend the analysis to the ways in which the economy can
               influence the prices of the following: nominal default-free debt; credit risky debt
               (for example, corporate bonds); publicly traded equities; and commercial real estate.  ","explain the notion that to affect market values, economic factors must affect one
                     or more of the following: 1) default-free interest rates across maturities, 2) the

"Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies",Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," There are many ways in which investment managers and investors can use swaps, forwards,
               futures, and volatility derivatives. The typical applications of these derivatives
               involve modifying investment positions for hedging purposes or for taking directional
               bets, creating or replicating desired payoffs, implementing asset allocation and portfolio
               rebalancing decisions, and even inferring current market expectations. The following
               table shows some common uses of these derivatives in portfolio management and the
               types of derivatives used by investors and portfolio managers. It is important for an informed investment professional to understand how swaps, forwards,

Overview of Equity Portfolio Management,Equity Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Equities represent a sizable portion of the global investment universe and thus often
               represent a primary component of investors’ portfolios. Rationales for investing in
               equities include potential participation in the growth and earnings prospects of an
               economy’s corporate sector as well as an ownership interest in a range of business
               entities by size, economic activity, and geographical scope. Publicly traded equities
               are generally more liquid than other asset classes and thus may enable investors to
               more easily monitor price trends and purchase or sell securities with low transaction
               costs. This reading provides an overview of equity portfolio management. Section 2 discusses
               the roles of equities in a portfolio. Section 3 discusses the equity investment universe,

Options Strategies,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Derivatives are financial instruments through which counterparties agree to exchange
               economic cash flows based on the movement of underlying securities, indexes, currencies,
               or other instruments or factors. A derivative’s value is thusderivedfrom the economic performance of the underlying. Derivatives may be created directly
               by counterparties or may be facilitated through established, regulated market exchanges.
               Direct creation between counterparties has the benefit of tailoring to the counterparties’
               specific needs but also the disadvantage of potentially low liquidity. Exchange-traded
               derivatives often do not match counterparties’ specific needs but do facilitate early
               termination of the position, and, importantly, mitigate counterparty risk. Derivatives
               facilitate the exchange of economic risks and benefits where trades in the underlying
               securities might be less advantageous because of poor liquidity, transaction costs,
               regulatory impediments, tax or accounting considerations, or other factors. Options are an important type of contingent-claim derivative that provide their owner
               with the right but not an obligation to a payoff determined by the future price of
               the underlying asset. Unlike other types of derivatives (i.e., swaps, forwards, and
               futures), options have nonlinear payoffs that enable their owners to benefit from
               movements in the underlying in one direction without being hurt by movements in the
               opposite direction. The cost of this opportunity, however, is the upfront cash payment
               required to enter the options position. Options can be combined with the underlying and with other options in a variety of
               different ways to modify investment positions, to implement investment strategies,
               or even to infer market expectations. Therefore, investment managers routinely use
               option strategies for hedging risk exposures, for seeking to profit from anticipated
               market moves, and for implementing desired risk exposures in a cost-effective manner. The main purpose of this reading is to illustrate how options strategies are used
               in typical investment situations and to show the risk–return trade-offs associated
               with their use. Importantly, an informed investment professional should have such
               a basic understanding of options strategies to competently serve his investment clients. Section 2 of this reading shows how certain combinations of securities (i.e., options,
               underlying) are equivalent to others. Section 3 discusses two of the most widely used
               options strategies, covered calls and protective puts. In Section 4, we look at popular
               spread and combination option strategies used by investors. The focus of Section 5
               is implied volatility embedded in option prices and related volatility skew and surface.
               Section 6 discusses option strategy selection. Section 7 demonstrates a series of
               applications showing ways in which an investment manager might solve an investment
               problem with options. The reading concludes with a summary.  ","demonstrate how an asset’s returns may be replicated by using options;

Currency Management: An Introduction,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Globalization has been one of the most persistent themes in recent history, and this
               theme applies equally to the world of finance. New investment products, deregulation,
               worldwide financial system integration, and better communication and information networks
               have opened new global investment opportunities. At the same time, investors have
               increasingly shed their “home bias” and sought investment alternatives beyond their
               own borders. The benefits of this trend for portfolio managers have been clear, both in terms of
               the broader availability of higher-expected-return investments as well as portfolio
               diversification opportunities. Nonetheless, investments denominated in foreign currencies
               also bring a unique set of challenges: measuring and managing foreign exchange risk.
               Buying foreign-currency denominated assets means bringing currency risk into the portfolio.
               Exchange rates are volatile and, at least in the short to medium term, can have a
               marked impact on investment returns and risks—currency matters. The key to the superior performance of global portfolios is the effective management
               of this currency risk. This reading explores basic concepts and tools of currency management. Section 2 reviews
               some of the basic concepts of foreign exchange (FX) markets. The material in subsequent
               sections presumes an understanding of these concepts. Section 3 examines some of the
               basic mathematics involved in measuring the effects of foreign-currency investments
               on portfolio return and risk. Section 4 discusses thestrategicdecisions portfolio managers face in setting the target currency exposures of the
               portfolio. The currency exposures that the portfolio can accept range from a fully
               hedged position to active management of currency risk. Section 5 discusses some of
               thetacticalconsiderations involving active currency management if the investment policy statement
               (IPS) extends some latitude for active currency management. A requisite to any active
               currency management is having a market view; so this section includes various methodologies
               by which a manager can form directional views on future exchange rate movements and
               volatility. Section 6 covers a variety of trading tools available to implement both
               hedging and active currency management strategies. Although the generic types of FX
               derivatives tools are relatively limited—spot, forward, option, and swap contracts—the
               number of variations within each and the number of combinations in which they can
               be used is vast. Section 7 examines some of the issues involved in managing the currency
               exposures of emerging market currencies—that is, those that are less liquid than the
               major currencies. Section 8 presents a summary.  ","analyze the effects of currency movements on portfolio risk and return;

Liability-Driven and Index-Based Strategies,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Fixed-income instruments make up nearly three-quarters of all global financial assets available to investors. It is thus not surprising that bonds are a critical component of most investment portfolios. In our coverage of structured and passive total return fixed-income investment strategies, we explain that “passive” does not simply mean “buy and hold.” The primary strategies discussed—immunization and indexation—can entail frequent rebalancing of the bond portfolio. We also note that “passive” stands in contrast to “active” fixed-income strategies that are based on the asset manager’s particular view on interest rate and credit market conditions. We explain liability-driven investing by demonstrating how to best structure a fixed-income portfolio when considering both the asset and liability sides of the investor’s balance sheet. It is first important to have a thorough understanding of both the timing and relative certainty of future financial obligations. Because it is rare to find a bond investment whose characteristics perfectly match one’s obligations, we introduce the idea of structuring a bond portfolio to match the future cash flows of one or more liabilities that have bond-like characteristics. Asset–liability management (ALM) strategies are based on the concept that investors incorporate both rate-sensitive assets and liabilities into the portfolio decision-making process. When the liabilities are given and assets are managed, liability-driven investing (LDI), a common type of ALM strategy, may be used to ensure adequate funding for an insurance portfolio, a pension plan, or an individual’s budget after retirement. The techniques and risks associated with LDI are introduced using a single liability and then are expanded to cover both cash flow and duration-matching techniques and multiple liabilities. This strategy, known as immunization, may be viewed simply as a special case of interest rate hedging. We then turn our attention to index-based investment strategies, through which investors gain a broader exposure to fixed-income markets, rather than tailoring investments to match a specific liability profile. We explain the advantages of index-based investing, such as diversification, but we also note that the depth and breadth of bond markets make both creating and tracking an index more challenging than in the equity markets. We also explore a variety of alternatives in matching a bond index, from full replication to enhanced indexing using primary risk factors. Finally, we explain that it is critical to select a benchmark that is most relevant to a specific investor based on factors such as the targeted duration profile and risk appetite.

Passive Equity Investing,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," This reading provides a broad overview of passive equity investing, including index
selection, portfolio management techniques, and the analysis of investment results. Although they mean different things, passive equity investing and indexing have become
nearly synonymous in the investment industry. Indexing refers to strategies intended
to replicate the performance of benchmark indexes, such as the S&P 500 Index, the
Topix 100, the FTSE 100, and the MSCI All-Country World Index. The main advantages
of indexing include low costs, broad diversification, and tax efficiency. Indexing
is the purest form of a more general idea: passive investing. Passive investing refers
to any rules-based, transparent, and investable strategy that does not involve identifying
mispriced individual securities. Unlike indexing, however, passive investing can include
investing in a changing set of market segments that are selected by the portfolio
manager. Studies over the years have reported support for passive investing. Renshaw and Feldstein (1960) observe that the returns of professionally managed portfolios trailed the returns
on the principal index of that time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They also conclude
that the index would be a good basis for what they termed an “unmanaged investment
company.” French (2008) indicates that the cost of passive investing is lower than the cost of active management. Further motivation for passive investing comes from studies that examine the return
and risk consequences of stock selection, which involves identifying mispriced securities.
This differs from asset allocation, which involves selecting asset class investments
that are, themselves, essentially passive indexed-based portfolios. Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986) find a dominant role for asset allocation rather than security selection in explaining
return variability. With passive investing, portfolio managers eschew the idea of
security selection, concluding that the benefits do not justify the costs. The efficient market hypothesis gave credence to investors’ interest in indexes by
theorizing that stock prices incorporate all relevant information—implying that after
costs, the majority of active investors could not consistently outperform the market.
With this backdrop, investment managers began to offer strategies to replicate the
returns of stock market indexes as early as 1971. In comparison with passive investing strategies, active management of an investment
portfolio requires a substantial commitment of personnel, technological resources,
and time spent on analysis and management that can involve significant costs. Consequently,
passive portfolio fees charged to investors are generally much lower than fees charged
by their active managers. This fee differential represents the most significant and
enduring advantage of passive management. Another advantage is that passive managers seeking to track an index can generally
achieve their objective. Passive managers model their clients’ portfolios to the benchmark’s
constituent securities and weights as reported by the index provider, thereby replicating
the benchmark. The skill of a passive manager is apparent in the ability to trade,
report, and explain the performance of a client’s portfolio. Gross-of-fees performance
among passive managers tends to be similar, so much of the industry views passive
managers as undifferentiated apart from their scope of offerings and client-servicing
capabilities. Investors of passively managed funds may seek market return, otherwise known as beta
exposure, and do not seek outperformance, known as alpha. A focus on beta is based
on a single-factor model: the capital asset pricing model. Since the turn of the millennium, passive factor-based strategies, which are based
on more than a single factor, have become more prevalent as investors gain a different
understanding of what drives investment returns. These strategies maintain the low-cost
advantage of index funds and provide a different expected return stream based on exposure
to such factors as style, capitalization, volatility, and quality. This reading contains the following sections. Section 2 focuses on how to choose a
passive benchmark, including weighting considerations. Section 3 looks at how to gain
exposure to the desired index, whether through a pooled investment, a derivatives-based
approach, or a separately managed account. Section 4 describes passive portfolio construction
techniques. Section 5 discusses how a portfolio manager can control tracking error
against the benchmark, including the sources of tracking error. Section 6 introduces
methods a portfolio manager can use to attribute the sources of return in the portfolio,
including country returns, currency returns, sector returns, and security returns.
This section also describes sources of portfolio risk. A summary of key points concludes
the reading.  ","discuss considerations in choosing a benchmark for a passively managed equity portfolio;

Using Multifactor Models,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," As used in investments, a factor is a variable or a characteristic with which individual asset returns are correlated. Models using multiple factors are used by asset owners, asset managers, investment consultants, and risk managers for a variety of portfolio construction, portfolio management, risk management, and general analytical purposes. In comparison to single-factor models (typically based on a market risk factor), multifactor models offer increased explanatory power and flexibility. These comparative strengths of multifactor models allow practitioners to Multifactor models have come to dominate investment practice, having demonstrated their value in helping asset managers and asset owners address practical tasks in measuring and controlling risk. We explain and illustrate the various practical uses of multifactor models. We first describe the modern portfolio theory background of multifactor models. We then describe arbitrage pricing theory and provide a general expression for multifactor models. We subsequently explore the types of multifactor models and certain applications.

Overview of Fixed-Income Portfolio Management,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Investors often seek regular income from their investments as well as a predetermined date when their capital will be returned. Fixed-income investments offer both. Fixed-income instruments include a broad range of publicly traded securities (such as commercial paper, notes, and bonds traded through exchanges as well as OTC) and non-publicly traded instruments (such as loans and private placements). Individual loans or fixed-income obligations may be bundled into a pool of assets supporting such instruments as asset-backed securities and covered bonds. Fixed-income portfolio managers combine these diverse instruments across issuers, maturities, and jurisdictions to meet the various needs of investors. We discuss the different roles of fixed-income securities in portfolios and explain the two main types of fixed-income mandates—liability-based mandates and total return mandates—as well as bond market liquidity. We also provide an overview of portfolio measures, instruments, and vehicles used in fixed-income portfolio management and introduce a model of how a bond position’s total expected return can be decomposed.  ","discuss roles of fixed-income securities in portfolios and how fixed-income mandates may be classified;

Yield Curve Strategies,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," The size and breadth of global fixed-income markets, as well as the term structure of interest rates within and across countries, lead investors to consider numerous factors when creating and managing a bond portfolio. While fixed-income index replication and bond portfolios that consider both an investor’s assets and liabilities were addressed earlier in the curriculum, we now turn our attention to active bond portfolio management. In contrast to a passive index strategy, active fixed-income management involves taking positions in primary risk factors that deviate from those of an index in order to generate excess return. Financial analysts who can successfully apply fixed-income concepts and tools to evaluate yield curve changes and position a portfolio based upon an interest rate view find this to be a valuable skill throughout their careers. Prioritizing fixed-income risk factors is a key first step. In what follows, we focus on the yield curve, which represents the term structure of interest rates for government or benchmark securities, with the assumption that all promised principal and interest payments take place. Fixed-income securities, which trade at a spread above the benchmark to compensate investors for credit and liquidity risk, will be addressed later in the curriculum. The starting point for active portfolio managers is the current term structure of benchmark interest rates and an interest rate view established using macroeconomic variables introduced earlier. In what follows, we demonstrate how managers may position a fixed-income portfolio to capitalize on expectations regarding the level, slope, or shape (curvature) of yield curves using both long and short cash positions, derivatives, and leverage.

Hedge Fund Strategies,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level III," Hedge funds form an important subset of the alternative investments opportunity set,
               but they come with many pros and cons in their use and application across different
               asset classes and investment approaches. The basic tradeoff is whether the added fees
               typically involved with hedge fund investing result in sufficient additional alpha
               and portfolio diversification benefits to justify the high fee levels. This is an
               ongoing industry debate. Some argue that investing in hedge funds is a key way to access the very best investment
               talent—those individuals who can adroitly navigate investment opportunities across
               a potentially wider universe of markets. Others argue that hedge funds are important
               because the alpha that may be produced in down markets is hard to source elsewhere. The arguments against hedge funds are also non-trivial. In addition to the high fee
               levels, the complex offering memorandum documentation needs to be understood by investors
               (i.e., the limited partners). Other issues include lack of full underlying investment
               transparency/attribution, higher cost allocations associated with the establishment
               and maintenance of the fund investment structures, and generally longer–lived investment
               commitment periods with limited redemption availability. In addition, each hedge fund strategy area tends to introduce different types of added
               portfolio risks. For example, to achieve meaningful return objectives, arbitrage-oriented
               hedge fund strategies tend to utilize significant leverage that can be dangerous to
               limited partner investors, especially during periods of market stress. Long/short
               equity and event-driven strategies may have less beta exposure than simple, long-only
               beta allocations, but the higher hedge fund fees effectively result in a particularly
               expensive form of embedded beta. Such strategies as managed futures or global macro
               investing may introduce natural benefits of asset class and investment approach diversification,
               but they come with naturally higher volatility in the return profiles typically delivered.
               Extreme tail risk in portfolios may be managed with the inclusion of relative value
               volatility or long volatility strategies, but it comes at the cost of a return drag
               during more normal market periods. In other words, some hedge fund strategies may
               have higher portfolio diversification benefits, while others may simply be return
               enhancers rather than true portfolio diversifiers. Also, the hedge fund industry continues to evolve in its overall structure. Over the
               past decade, traditional limited partnership formats have been supplemented by offerings
               of liquid alternatives (liquid alts)—which are mutual fund, closed-end fund, and ETF-type
               vehicles that invest in various hedge fund-like strategies. Liquid alts are meant
               to provide daily liquidity, transparency, and lower fees while opening hedge fund
               investing to a wider range of investors. However, empirical evidence shows that liquid
               alts significantly underperform similar strategy hedge funds, which suggests that
               traditional hedge funds may be benefiting from an illiquidity premium phenomenon that
               cannot be easily transported into a mutual fund format. Investors must understand the various subtleties involved with investing in hedge
               funds. Although secular bull market trends have arguably made “hedged” strategies
               less critical for inclusion in portfolio allocations than they were during the mid-to-late
               2000s, the overall popularity of hedge funds tends to be somewhat cyclical. Notably,
               as demonstrated by the endowment model of investing, placing hedge funds as a core
               allocation can increase net returns and reduce risk. This reading presents the investment characteristics and implementation for the major
               categories of hedge fund strategies. It also provides a framework for classifying
               and evaluating these strategies based on their risk profiles. Section 2 summarizes
               some distinctive regulatory and investment characteristics of hedge funds and discusses
               ways to classify hedge fund strategies. Sections 3 through 8 present investment characteristics
               and strategy implementation for each of the following six hedge fund strategy categories:
               equity-related; event-driven; relative value; opportunistic; specialist; and multi-manager
               strategies. Section 9 introduces a conditional factor model as a unifying framework
               for understanding and analyzing the risk exposures of these strategies. Section 10
               evaluates the contributions of each hedge fund strategy to the return and risk profile
               of a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds. The reading concludes with a summary.  ","discuss how hedge fund strategies may be classified;

Measuring and Managing Market Risk,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," This reading is an introduction to the process of measuring and managing market risk. Market risk is the risk that arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices. Market risk is distinguished from credit risk, which is the risk of loss from the failure of a counterparty to make a promised payment, and also from a number of other risks that organizations face, such as breakdowns in their operational procedures. In essence, market risk is the risk arising from changes in the markets to which an organization has exposure. Risk management is the process of identifying and measuring risk and ensuring that the risks being taken are consistent with the desired risks. The process of managing market risk relies heavily on the use of models. A model is a simplified representation of a real world phenomenon. Financial models attempt to capture the important elements that determine prices and sensitivities in financial markets. In doing so, they provide critical information necessary to manage investment risk. For example, investment risk models help a portfolio manager understand how much the value of the portfolio is likely to change given a change in a certain risk factor. They also provide insight into the gains and losses the portfolio might reasonably be expected to experience and the frequency with which large losses might occur. Effective risk management, though, is much more than just applying financial models. It requires the application of judgment and experience not only to know how to use the models appropriately but also to appreciate the strengths and limitations of the models and to know when to supplement or substitute one model with another model or approach. Financial markets operate more or less continuously, and new prices are constantly being generated. As a result, there is a large amount of data on market risk and a lot of collective experience dealing with this risk, making market risk one of the easier financial risks to analyze. Still, market risk is not an easy risk to capture. Although a portfolio’s exposures can be identified with some certainty, the potential losses that could arise from those exposures are unknown. The data used to estimate potential losses are generated from past prices and rates, not the ones to come. Risk management models allow the experienced risk manager to blend that historical data with their own forward-looking judgment, providing a framework within which to test that judgment. We first lay a foundation for understanding value at risk, discuss three primary approaches to estimating value at risk, and cover the primary advantages and limitations as well as extensions of value at risk. We then address the sensitivity measures used for equities, fixed-income securities, and options and also cover historical and hypothetical scenario risk measures. Next, we discuss the use of constraints in risk management, such as risk budgeting, position limits, scenario limits, stop-loss limits, and capital allocation as risk management tools. Lastly, we describe various applications and limitations of risk measures as used by different types of market participants and summarize our discussion.

Derivative Markets and Instruments,Derivatives,"2022
 Curriculum",Level I," Equity, fixed-income, currency, and commodity markets are facilities for trading the basic assets of an economy. Equity and fixed-income securities are claims on the assets of a company. Currencies are the monetary units issued by a government or central bank. Commodities are natural resources, such as oil or gold. These underlying assets are said to trade incash marketsorspot marketsand their prices are sometimes referred to ascash pricesorspot prices, though we usually just refer to them as stock prices, bond prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices. These markets exist around the world and receive much attention in the financial and mainstream media. Hence, they are relatively familiar not only to financial experts but also to the general population. Somewhat less familiar are the markets forderivatives, which are financial instruments that derive their values from the performance of these basic assets. This reading is an overview of derivatives. Subsequent readings will explore many aspects of derivatives and their uses in depth. Among the questions that this first reading will address are the following: This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 explores the definition and uses of derivatives and establishes some basic terminology. Section 3 describes derivatives markets. Section 4 categorizes and explains types of derivatives. Sections 5 and 6 discuss the benefits and criticisms of derivatives, respectively. Section 7 introduces the basic principles of derivative pricing and the concept of arbitrage. Section 8 provides a summary.  ","define a derivative and distinguish between exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives;

Mergers and Acquisitions,Corporate Finance,"2022
 Curriculum",Level II," Companies enter into corporate restructuring activities such as mergers and acquisitions
               for a variety of reasons. Many companies use mergers as a means to achieve growth
               or gain operational efficiencies. Others seek to acquire unique capabilities or resources,
               increase market power, or diversify their businesses. In all cases, it is important
               for both equity and fixed income analysts to understand the motives for mergers and
               their financial and operational consequences. Merger and acquisition (M&A) activities involve a variety of complexities and risks.
               Analysts should assess these factors, including the expected value arising from a
               proposed business combination relative to deal price, in addition to the likelihood
               that the combination will take place and the intended results will be achieved. They
               should also consider actions taken by other shareholders, regulators, market participants,
               and competitors, in addition to transaction specifics, given the potential impact
               of all these factors on deal completion and valuation. Analysts should be able to answer questions such as: Does the proposed transaction
               make economic sense and align with management’s stated business strategy? How is the
               transaction being financed, and how will this financing approach affect company financials?
               How likely is the deal to take place, and what are associated risks? In the case of
               a hostile bid, does the target company have options to successfully fend off the unwanted
               bid? What is the anticipated impact for shareholders? Bondholders? This reading will discuss many of the issues involved in M&A deals, such as form of
               payment in a merger, legal and contractual issues, and the necessity for regulatory
               approval. Most importantly, this reading aims to equip you with basic tools and a
               framework for analyzing such deals. In subsequent sections, we will discuss basic
               types of M&A, underlying motives, transaction characteristics, governing regulations,
               and how to evaluate a target company and a proposed merger.  ","classify merger and acquisition (M&A) activities based on forms of integration and
                     relatedness of business activities;
explain common motivations behind M&A activity;

Industry and Company Analysis,Equity Investments,"2022
 Curriculum",Level II," Industry and company analysis is a key step in the process of valuing companies and
               the securities they have issued. We will focus on how analysts use industry information
               and corporate disclosures to forecast a company’s future financial results. Financial forecasts are the basis for fundamental equity valuation based on discounted
               cash flows and/or market multiples. An effective forecast model must be based on a
               thorough understanding of a company’s business, management, strategy, external environment,
               and historical results. Thus, an analyst begins with a review of the company and its
               environment—its industry, key products, strategic position, management, competitors,
               suppliers, and customers. Using this information, an analyst identifies key revenue
               and cost drivers and assesses the likely impact of relevant trends, such as economic
               conditions and technological developments. An analyst’s understanding of the fundamental
               drivers of the business and an assessment of future events provide a basis for developing
               inputs to the forecast model. We begin our discussion with an overview of developing a forecast model. We then describe
               the general approach to forecasting each component of the income statement (revenue,
               operating costs, and non-operating costs), balance sheet, and cash flow statement.
               We then turn to special topics: the impact of competitive factors on prices and costs;
               the effects of inflation and deflation; technological developments; long-term forecasting;
               and building a company model. We then conclude and present a summary.  ","compare top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches for developing inputs to equity
                     valuation models;
compare “growth relative to GDP growth” and “market growth and market share” approaches

Basics of Multiple Regression and Underlying Assumptions,Quantitative Methods,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to describe the variation of the dependent variable rather than just one independent variable, as in simple linear regression. It allows the analyst to estimate using more complex models with multiple explanatory variables and, if used correctly, may lead to better predictions, better portfolio construction, or better understanding of the drivers of security returns. If used incorrectly, however, multiple linear regression may yield spurious relationships, lead to poor predictions, and offer a poor understanding of relationships. The analyst must first specify the model and make several decisions in this process. The analyst must answer the following questions: What is the dependent variable of interest? What independent variables are important? What form should the model take? What is the goal of the model—prediction or understanding of the relationship? The analyst specifies the dependent and independent variables and then employs software to estimate the model and produce related statistics. The good news is that the software does the estimation (see Exhibit 1). The analyst’s primary tasks are to specify the model and interpret the output from this software, which are the main subjects of this content.  ","describe the types of investment problems addressed by multiple linear regression and the regression process;
formulate a multiple linear regression model, describe the relation between the dependent variable and several independent variables, and interpret estimated regression coefficients; and
explain the assumptions underlying a multiple linear regression model and interpret residual plots indicating potential violations of these assumptions.",https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R1_multiple_regression_basics.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/multiple-regression
Time Value of Money in Finance,Quantitative Methods,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," As individuals, we often face decisions that involve saving money for a future use, or borrowing money for current consumption. We then need to determine the amount we need to invest, if we are saving, or the cost of borrowing, if we are shopping for a loan. As investment analysts, much of our work also involves evaluating transactions with present and future cash flows. When we place a value on any security, for example, we are attempting to determine the worth of a stream of future cash flows. To carry out all the above tasks accurately, we must understand the mathematics of time value of money problems. Money has time value in that individuals value a given amount of money more highly the earlier it is received. Therefore, a smaller amount of money now may be equivalent in value to a larger amount received at a future date. Thetime value of moneyas a topic in investment mathematics deals with equivalence relationships between cash flows with different dates. Mastery of time value of money concepts and techniques is essential for investment analysts. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces some terminology used throughout the reading and supplies some economic intuition for the variables we will discuss. Section 3 tackles the problem of determining the worth at a future point in time of an amount invested today. Section 4 addresses the future worth of a series of cash flows. These two sections provide the tools for calculating the equivalent value at a future date of a single cash flow or series of cash flows. Sections 5 and 6 discuss the equivalent value today of a single future cash flow and a series of future cash flows, respectively. In Section 7, we explore how to determine other quantities of interest in time value of money problems.  ","interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs;
explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing distinct types of risk;

Fintech in Investment Management,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I,"The meeting of finance and technology, commonly known as fintech, is changing the landscape of investment management. Advancements include the use of Big Data, AI, and ML to evaluate investment opportunities, optimize portfolios, and mitigate risks. These developments are affecting not only quantitative asset managers but also fundamental asset managers who make use of these tools and technologies to engage in hybrid forms of investment decision making.Investment advisory services are undergoing changes with the growth of automated wealth advisers or “robo-advisers.” Robo-advisers might assist investors without the intervention of a human adviser, or they might be used in combination with a human adviser. The desired outcome is the ability to provide tailored, actionable advice to investors with greater ease of access and at lower cost.In the area of financial record keeping, blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) are creating new ways to record, track, and store transactions for financial assets. An early example of this trend is the cryptocurrency bitcoin, but the technology is being considered in a broader set of applications.This reading is divided into seven main sections, which together define fintech and outline some of its key areas of impact in the field of investment management. Section 1 explains the concept and areas of fintech. Sections 2 and 3 discuss Big Data, AI, and ML.

Overview of Types of Real Estate Investment,Alternative Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Real estate property is an asset class that plays a significant role in many investment portfolios and is an attractive source of current income. Investor allocations to public and private real estate have increased significantly over the last 20 years. Because of the distinct characteristics of real estate property, real estate investments tend to behave differently from other asset classes—such as stocks, bonds, and commodities—and thus have different risks and diversification benefits. Private real estate investments are further differentiated because the investments are not publicly traded and require analytic techniques different from those of publicly traded assets. Because of the lack of directly comparable transactions, an appraisal process is required to value real estate property. Many of the indexes and benchmarks used for private real estate also rely on appraisals. Because of this characteristic, they behave differently from indexes for publicly traded equities, such as the S&P 500, MSCI Europe, FTSE Asia Pacific, and many other regional and global indexes.  ","compare the characteristics, classifications, principal risks, and basic forms of public and private real estate investments;

Introduction to Corporate Governance and Other ESG Considerations,Corporate Finance,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I,"All companies operate in a complex ecosystem composed of interested stakeholder groups that are dependent on the company as well as each other for economic success. Key stakeholder groups include the company’s capital providers, otherwise referred to as its debt- and equityholders. In addition, companies have a number of other interested parties.These stakeholder groups do not necessarily share the same goals for, nor seek the same ends from, the company. The interests of any one stakeholder group may diverge or conflict with that of others and, in some cases, with the interests of the company itself. A company’s ability to maximize long-term value for shareholders and generate sufficient profitability to make its debt obligations is compromised if one stakeholder group is able to consistently extract benefits to the detriment of another group. Therefore, the controls and mechanisms to harmonize and safeguard the interests of the company’s stakeholders are key areas of both interest and risk for financial analysts.

Sources of Capital,Corporate Finance,"2022
 Curriculum",Level I," Raising capital is a fundamental business activity, and companies have multiple short-term and long-term financing choices. Short-term funds without explicit interest rates, such as accounts payable, are part of working capital management, which is the management of short-term assets and liabilities. Other debt and equity obligations used to finance the business longer term are considered part of the firm’s capital structure. The goal of effective working capital management is to ensure that a company has adequate, ready access to the funds necessary for day-to-day operations, while at the same time making sure that the company’s assets are invested in the most productive way. The goal of capital structure management is to balance the risks and costs of the firm’s long-term finances. In this reading, we examine a variety of debt and equity claims that companies rely on for their sources of capital. This reading also considers sources of liquidity and how to judge the liquidity positions of firms.  ","describe types of financing methods and considerations in their selection;

Uses of Capital,Corporate Finance,"2022
 Curriculum",Level I," To achieve profitability and reach sustainability, a company must use its resources effectively and make long-term investments that increase revenues and profits. Investment opportunities returning long-term benefits and future cash flows greater than their associated cost to fund generate value for companies and corresponding wealth for their owners. Decisions on where and when to make long-term capital investments are, therefore, key management decisions central to a company’s operating success and longevity. Understanding how companies allocate their capital among competing priorities and their resulting portfolios of investment activity is a fundamental area of knowledge for financial analysts for many reasons. The allocation and investment of capital are important corporate activities. Capital investments (also referred to here as capital projects) are investments with a life of one year or longer, and they make up the long-term asset portion of the balance sheet. They can be so large that sound capital allocation decisions ultimately decide the future success of many corporations. Capital investments also describe a company’s future prospects better than its working capital or capital structure, which are intangible and often similar for companies. Analysts may attempt to estimate the process, within reason, for companies that are not too complex and, in doing so, better evaluate corporate decisions that extend to financing and other related activity. Analysts may also be able to appraise the quality of the company’s capital allocation process—for example, on the basis of whether the company has an accounting focus or an economic focus. In doing so, analysts derive insights into how the company is creating value for investors. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the steps taken by companies in a typical capital allocation process and the basic principles of capital allocation. In Section 3, we introduce basic investment decision criteria, and in Section 4, we discuss capital allocation options—known as real options—that allow their holders, in this case companies, to make decisions in the future that alter the value of their capital investment decisions made today.  Section 5 covers a discussion of the common capital allocation pitfalls often made by companies, and a summary concludes the reading.

Capital Budgeting: Level II,Corporate Finance,"2021
 Curriculum",Level II," Capital budgeting is the process that companies use for investing in capital projects—those
               projects with a life of a year or more. The Level I curriculum presented the basic
               principles of this process and the major discounted cash flow (DCF) investment criteria:
               net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). The payback period and
               the accounting rate of return also are commonly used, although they have drawbacks
               compared with DCF methods. This reading expands on the basic principles by projecting
               the cash flows needed in these models and applying the models to a variety of more
               complicated situations. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a crucial element of the
               capital budgeting process: organizing the cash flow information that is the raw material
               of the analysis. Section 3 looks further at cash flow analysis, considering alternative
               depreciation methods, replacement projects (in contract to expansion projects), and
               the effects of inflation. Section 4 demonstrates methods to extend the basic investment
               criteria to address economic alternatives and risk. These methods include mutually
               exclusive projects with differing lives, sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis,
               simulation models, and real options analysis. This section also discusses several
               common pitfalls in capital budgeting analysis. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the reading.  ","calculate the yearly cash flows of expansion and replacement capital projects and

The Arbitrage-Free Valuation Framework,Fixed Income,"2021
 Curriculum",Level II," The idea that market prices will adjust until there are no opportunities for arbitrage
               underpins the valuation of fixed-income securities, derivatives, and other financial
               assets. It is as intuitive as it is well-known. For a given investment, if the net
               proceeds are zero (e.g., buying and selling the same dollar amount of stocks) and
               the risk is zero, the return should be zero. Valuation tools must produce a value
               that is arbitrage free. The purpose of this reading is to develop a set of valuation
               tools for bonds that are consistent with this notion. The reading is organized around the learning objectives. After this brief introduction,
               Section 2 defines an arbitrage opportunity and discusses the implications of no arbitrage
               for the valuation of fixed-income securities. Section 3 presents some essential ideas
               and tools from yield curve analysis needed to introduce the binomial interest rate
               tree. In this section, the binomial interest rate tree framework is developed and
               used to value an option-free bond. The process used to calibrate the interest rate
               tree to match the current yield curve is introduced. This step ensures that the interest
               rate tree is consistent with pricing using the zero-coupon (i.e., spot) curve. The
               final topic presented in the section is an introduction of pathwise valuation. Section
               4 describes a Monte Carlo forward-rate simulation and its application. A summary of
               the major results is given in Section 5.  ","explain what is meant by arbitrage-free valuation of a fixed-income instrument;

Analysis of Dividends and Share Repurchases,Corporate Finance,"2021
 Curriculum",Level II," This reading covers the features and characteristics of dividends and share repurchases
as well as the theory and practice of corporate payout policy. Adividendis a distribution paid to shareholders. Dividends are declared (i.e., authorized)
by a corporation’s board of directors, whose actions may require approval by shareholders
(e.g., in most of Europe) or may not require such approval (e.g., in the United States).
Shares tradingex-dividendrefers to shares that no longer carry the right to the next dividend payment. Theex-dividend dateis the first date that a share trades without (i.e., “ex”) this right to receive
the declared dividend for the period. All else holding constant, on the ex-dividend
date the share price can be expected to drop by the amount of the dividend. In contrast
to the payment of interest and principal on a bond by its issuer, the payment of dividends
is discretionary rather than a legal obligation and may be limited in amount by legal
statutes and debt contract provisions. Dividend payments and interest payments in
many jurisdictions are subject to different tax treatment at both the corporate and
personal levels. In this reading, we focus on dividends on common shares (as opposed to preferred shares)
paid by publicly traded companies. A company’spayout policyis the set of principles guiding cash dividends and the value of shares repurchased
in any given year. Payout policy (also called distribution policy) is more general
than dividend policy because it reflects the fact that companies can return cash to
shareholders by means of share repurchases and cash dividends. One of the longest
running debates in corporate finance concerns the impact of a company’s payout policy
on common shareholders’ wealth. Payout decisions, along with financing (capital structure)
decisions, generally involve the board of directors and senior management and are
closely watched by investors and analysts. Dividends and share repurchases concern analysts because, as distributions to shareholders,
they affect investment returns and financial ratios. The contribution of dividends
to total return for stocks is formidable. For example, the total compound annual return
for the S&P 500 Index with dividends reinvested from the beginning of 1926 to the
end of 2018 was 10.0%, as compared with 5.9% on the basis of price alone. Similarly,
from 1950 to 2018 the total compound annual return for the Nikkei 225 Index with dividends
reinvested was 11.1%, as compared with 8.0% on the basis of price alone. Dividends
also may provide important information about future company performance and investment
returns. Analysts should strive to become familiar with all investment-relevant aspects
of dividends and share repurchases. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the features and characteristics
of cash dividends, liquidating dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, and reverse
stock splits and describes their expected effect on shareholders’ wealth and a company’s
financial ratios. Section 3 presents theories of the effects of dividend policy on
company value. In Section 4, we discuss factors that affect dividend policy in practice.
In Section 5, we cover three major types of dividend policies. Section 6 presents
share repurchases, including their income statement and balance sheet effects and
equivalence to cash dividends (under certain assumptions). Section 7 presents global
trends in payout policy. Section 8 covers analysis of dividend safety. The reading
concludes with a summary.  ","describe the expected effect of regular cash dividends, extra dividends, liquidating
                     dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, and reverse stock splits on shareholders’

"Aggregate Output, Prices, and Economic Growth",Economics,"2021
 Curriculum",Level I," In the field of economics,microeconomicsis the study of the economic activity and behavior of individual economic units, such as a household, a company, or a market for a particular good or service, andmacroeconomicsis the study of the aggregate activities of households, companies, and markets. Macroeconomics focuses on national aggregates, such as totalinvestment, the amount spent by all businesses on plant and equipment; totalconsumption, the amount spent by all households on goods and services; the rate of change in the general level of prices; and the overall level of interest rates. Macroeconomic analysis examines a nation’s aggregate output and income, its competitive and comparative advantages, the productivity of its labor force, its price level and inflation rate, and the actions of its national government and central bank. The objective of macroeconomic analysis is to address such fundamental questions as: From an investment perspective, investors must be able to evaluate a country’s current economic environment and to forecast its future economic environment in order to identify asset classes and securities that will benefit from economic trends occurring within that country. Macroeconomic variables—such as the level of inflation, unemployment, consumption, government spending, and investment—affect the overall level of activity within a country. They also have different impacts on the growth and profitability of industries within a country, the companies within those industries, and the returns of the securities issued by those companies. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 describes gross domestic product and related measures of domestic output and income. Section 3 discusses short-run and long-run aggregate demand and supply curves, the causes of shifts and movements along those curves, and factors that affect equilibrium levels of output, prices, and interest rates.

Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct,Ethical and Professional Standards,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," TheStandards of Practice Handbook(Handbook) provides guidance to the people who grapple with real ethical dilemmas in the investment
               profession on a daily basis; theHandbookaddresses the professional intersection where theory meets practice and where the
               concept of ethical behavior crosses from the abstract to the concrete. TheHandbookis intended for a diverse and global audience: CFA Institute members navigating ambiguous
               ethical situations; supervisors and direct/indirect reports determining the nature
               of their responsibilities to each other, to existing and potential clients, and to
               the broader financial markets; and candidates preparing for the Chartered Financial
               Analyst (CFA) examinations. Recent events in the global financial markets have tested the ethical mettle of financial
               market participants, including CFA Institute members. The standards taught in the
               CFA Program and by which CFA Institute members and candidates must abide represent
               timeless ethical principles and professional conduct for all market conditions. Through
               adherence to these standards, which continue to serve as the model for ethical behavior

Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct,Ethical and Professional Standards,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," Asset managers hold a unique place of trust in the lives of millions of investors. Investment professionals and firms that undertake and perform their responsibilities with honesty and integrity are critical to maintaining investors’ trust and confidence and to upholding the client covenant of trust, loyalty, prudence, and care. CFA Institute and its members are committed to reinforcing those principles. The CFA Institute mission is to lead the investment profession globally by setting the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence. To foster this culture of ethics and professionalism, CFA Institute offers this voluntary code of conduct. It is designed to be broadly adopted within the industry as a template and guidepost for investors seeking managers who adhere to sound ethical practice. The Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct outlines the ethical and professional responsibilities of firms that manage assets on behalf of clients. Whereas the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct address individual conduct, this Code is meant to apply, on a global basis, to firms that manage client assets as separate accounts or pooled funds (including collective investment schemes, mutual funds, and fund of funds organizations); we refer to such firms as “Managers.” In part, this document responds to requests from Managers to extend the scope of the Code and Standards to the firm level. Although many institutional asset managers, particularly those in well-regulated jurisdictions, already have such a code in place, they should use this Code to evaluate their own code and ensure that all of this Code’s principles have been included. This Code also has been developed for use by asset managers, including hedge fund managers, who may not already have such a code in place. This second edition of the Code includes provisions relating to risk management as well as guidance for Managers seeking to claim compliance. Ethical leadership begins at the highest level of an organization; therefore, the Code should be adopted by the Manager’s senior management, board of directors, and similar oversight bodies. Such adoption sends a strong message regarding the importance of ethical behavior at the firm. Rather than creating rules that apply only to certain people or groups, this Code is intended to cover all employees of the firm. Although not every employee is actively involved in conduct covered in the Code, a code that is broadly applied reinforces the need for all employees to understand the ethical issues involved in the asset management business. By adopting and enforcing a code of conduct for their organizations, Managers demonstrate their commitment to ethical behavior and the protection of investors’ interests. In doing so, the Managers also protect and enhance the reputation of their organizations. The Code sets forth minimum ethical standards for providing asset management services for clients. It is meant to be general in nature and allows flexibility for asset managers of various sizes and structures to develop the particular policies and procedures necessary to implement the Code. The goal of this Code is to set forth a useful framework for all asset managers to provide services in a fair and professional manner and to fully disclose key elements of those services to clients, regardless of whether individual Managers are required to register or comply with applicable securities laws or regulations. Unregistered hedge fund managers, in particular, are encouraged to adopt the Code and implement its provisions to ensure fair dealing and integrity and to promote self-regulation in this dynamic sector. We recognize that in the highly regulated and complex business of investment management, the adoption of a code of ethics by itself is not sufficient to ensure ethical conduct. To be implemented effectively, the principles and standards embodied in the Code must be supported by appropriate compliance procedures. The specific procedures that translate principle into practice will depend on a variety of factors, including the business of the Manager, the type of clients, the size of the Manager (based on assets under management and on number of employees), the regulatory régime with which the Manager must comply, and other factors. Managers must adhere to all applicable laws and regulations governing their activities. Thus, the provisions of this Code may need to be supplemented with additional provisions to meet the requirements of applicable security regulation in markets around the world. Inevitably, in some markets, the Code will closely reflect or be aligned with existing regulation or accepted best practice and in other markets, the Code will expand on the existing work of regulatory authorities or may even break new ground. Furthermore, Managers operate in different types of market structures, which may affect the manner in which the Code can be applied. Despite these differences, the Code provides a universal set of principles and standards relevant to all asset managers. Clients have a responsibility to be aware of, understand, and monitor how their assets are invested. Yet, to fulfill this responsibility, clients must be able to count on full and fair disclosure from their Managers. Providing clients with a code of ethics that sets a framework for how the Manager conducts business is an important step toward developing the trust and confidence necessary for a successful investment management relationship.

Capital Structure,Corporate Finance,"2021
 Curriculum",Level II," The most important decision a company makes in pursuit of maximizing its value is
               typically the decision concerning what products to manufacture and/or what services
               to offer. The decision on how to finance investments (e.g., in factories and equipment),
               the so-called capital structure decision, is often seen as less important, even secondary.
               As we will see in this reading, the importance of the capital structure decision depends
               on the assumptions one makes about capital markets and the agents operating in it. Under the most restrictive set of assumptions, the capital structure decision—the
               choice between how much debt and how much equity a company uses in financing its investments—is
               irrelevant. That is, any level of debt is as good as any other. The capital structure
               decision is not only secondary but also irrelevant. However, as some of the underlying
               assumptions are relaxed, the choice of how much debt to have in the capital structure
               becomes meaningful. Under a particular set of assumptions, it is even possible to
               have an optimal level of debt in the capital structure—that is, a level of debt at
               which company value is maximized. In this reading, we first discuss the capital structure decision and the assumptions
               and theories that lead to alternative capital structures. We then present important
               practical issues for the analyst, such as differences in capital structure policies

Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation,Derivatives,"2021
 Curriculum",Level I," It is important to understand how prices of derivatives are determined. Whether one is on the buy side or the sell side, a solid understanding of pricing financial products is critical to effective investment decision making. After all, one can hardly determine what to offer or bid for a financial product, or any product for that matter, if one has no idea how its characteristics combine to create value. Understanding the pricing of financial assets is important. Discounted cash flow methods and models, such as the capital asset pricing model and its variations, are useful for determining the prices of financial assets. The unique characteristics of derivatives, however, pose some complexities not associated with assets, such as equities and fixed-income instruments. Somewhat surprisingly, however, derivatives also have some simplifying characteristics. For example, as we will see in this reading, in well-functioning derivatives markets the need to determine risk premiums is obviated by the ability to construct a risk-free hedge. Correspondingly, the need to determine an investor’s risk aversion is irrelevant for derivative pricing, although it is certainly relevant for pricing the underlying. The purpose of this reading is to establish the foundations of derivative pricing on a basic conceptual level. The following topics are covered: This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 explores two related topics, the pricing of the underlying assets on which derivatives are created and the principle of arbitrage. Section 3 describes the pricing and valuation of forwards, futures, and swaps. Section 4 introduces the pricing and valuation of options. Section 5 provides a summary.

Common Probability Distributions,Quantitative Methods,"2021
 Curriculum",Level I," In nearly all investment decisions we work with random variables. The return on a
stock and its earnings per share are familiar examples of random variables. To make
probability statements about a random variable, we need to understand its probability
distribution. Aprobability distributionspecifies the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a random variable. In this reading, we present important facts about four probability distributions and
their investment uses. These four distributions—the uniform, binomial, normal, and
lognormal—are used extensively in investment analysis. They are used in such basic
valuation models as the Black–Scholes–Merton option pricing model, the binomial option
pricing model, and the capital asset pricing model. With the working knowledge of
probability distributions provided in this reading, you will also be better prepared
to study and use other quantitative methods such as hypothesis testing, regression
analysis, and time-series analysis. After discussing probability distributions, we end the reading with a brief introduction
to Monte Carlo simulation, a computer-based tool for obtaining information on complex
problems. For example, an investment analyst may want to experiment with an investment
idea without actually implementing it. Or she may need to price a complex option for
which no simple pricing formula exists. In these cases and many others, Monte Carlo
simulation is an important resource. To conduct a Monte Carlo simulation, the analyst
must identify risk factors associated with the problem and specify probability distributions
for them. Hence, Monte Carlo simulation is a tool that requires an understanding of
probability distributions. Before we discuss specific probability distributions, we define basic concepts and
terms. We then illustrate the operation of these concepts through the simplest distribution,
the uniform distribution. That done, we address probability distributions that have
more applications in investment work but also greater complexity.  ","define a probability distribution and distinguish between discrete and continuous

Big Data Projects,Quantitative Methods,"2021
 Curriculum",Level II," Big data (also referred to as alternative data) encompasses data generated by financial markets (e.g., stock and bond prices), businesses (e.g., company financials, production volumes), governments (e.g., economic and trade data), individuals (e.g., credit card purchases, social media posts), sensors (e.g., satellite imagery, traffic patterns), and the Internet of Things, or IoT, (i.e., the network of interrelated digital devices that can transfer data among themselves without human interaction). A veritable explosion in big data has occurred over the past decade or so, especially in unstructured data generated from social media (e.g., posts, tweets, blogs), email and text communications, web traffic, online news sites, electronic images, and other electronic information sources. The prospects are for exponential growth in big data to continue. Investment managers are increasingly using big data in their investment processes as they strive to discover signals embedded in such data that can provide them with an information edge. They seek to augment structured data with a plethora of unstructured data to develop improved forecasts of trends in asset prices, detect anomalies, etc. A typical example involves a fund manager using financial text data from 10-K reports for forecasting stock sentiment (i.e., positive or negative), which can then be used as an input to a more comprehensive forecasting model that includes corporate financial data. Unlike structured data (numbers and values) that can be readily organized into data tables to be read and analyzed by computers, unstructured data typically require specific methods of preparation and refinement before being usable by machines (i.e., computers) and useful to investment professionals. Given the volume, variety, and velocity of available big data, it is important for portfolio managers and investment analysts to have a basic understanding of how unstructured data can be transformed into structured data suitable as inputs to machine learning (ML) methods (in fact, for any type of modeling methods) that can potentially improve their financial forecasts. This reading describes the steps in using big data, both structured and unstructured, in financial forecasting. The concepts and methods are then demonstrated in a case study of an actual big data project. The project uses text-based data derived from financial documents to train an ML model to classify text into positive or negative sentiment classes for the respective stocks and then to predict sentiment. Section 2 of the reading covers a description of the key characteristics of big data. Section 3 provides an overview of the steps in executing a financial forecasting project using big data. We then describe in Sections 4–6 key aspects of data preparation and wrangling, data exploration, and model training using structured data and unstructured (textual) data. In Section 7, we bring these pieces together by covering the execution of an actual big data project. A summary in Section 8 concludes the reading.

Analysis of Active Portfolio Management,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level II," The Markowitz (1952) framework of what was originally called modern portfolio theory (MPT) has now become
the prominent paradigm for communicating and applying principles of risk and return
in portfolio management. Much of the mathematics and terminology of mean–variance
portfolio theory was subsequently combined with the notion of informational efficiency
by Sharpe (1964) and other financial economists to develop equilibrium models, such as the traditional
capital asset pricing model. Separately, the tools of MPT were applied by Treynor and Black (1973) to guide investors in their selection of securities when prices differ from their
equilibrium values. The application of portfolio theory to active management was further
developed by Grinold (1989) in “The Fundamental Law of Active Management” and by Black and Litterman (1992). We summarize the principles of active portfolio management using the terminology and
mathematics of the fundamental law introduced by Grinold (1989) and further developed by Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2002). Active management theory deals with how an investor should construct a portfolio
given an assumed competitive advantage or skill in predicting returns. Thus, active
management relies on the assumption that financial markets are not perfectly efficient.
Although investors might ultimately care about total risk and return, when asset management
is delegated to professional investors in institutional settings (e.g., pension funds)
the appropriate perspective is risk and return relative to a benchmark portfolio.
In addition to the principal–agent problem in delegated asset management, the availability
of passively managed portfolios requires a focus on value added above and beyond the
alternative of a low-cost index fund. We assume an understanding of basic portfolio theory, including the mathematics of
expected values, variances, and correlation coefficients, as well as some familiarity
with the related disciplines of mean–variance optimization and multi-factor risk models.
The following sections introduce the mathematics of value added through active portfolio
management, including the concepts of active weights, relative returns, and performance
attribution systems. The subsequent section compares the well-known Sharpe ratio for
measuring the total risk-adjusted value added with the information ratio for measuring
relative risk-adjusted value added. This section also makes a distinction betweenex ante, or expected, risk and return versusex post, or realized, risk and return and explains that the information ratio is the best
criterion for evaluating active investors. We then introduce the fundamental law that
describes how relative skill, breadth of application, active management aggressiveness,
and the constraints in portfolio construction combine to affect value added. The remaining
sections provide examples of active portfolio management strategies in both the equity
and fixed-income markets, describe some of the practical limitations of the fundamental
law, and provide a summary of the concepts and principles.  ","describe how value added by active management is measured;
calculate and interpret the information ratio (ex postandex ante) and contrast it to the Sharpe ratio;

                     its component terms—transfer coefficient, information coefficient, breadth, and active

Asset Allocation with Real-World Constraints,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," This reading illustrates ways in which the asset allocation process must be adapted

               horizon as well as external constraints that may affect the asset allocation choice
               (Section 2). We also discuss the ways in which taxes influence the asset allocation
               process for the taxable investor (Section 3). In addition, we discuss the circumstances
               that should trigger a re-evaluation of the long-term strategic asset allocation (Section
               4), when and how an asset owner might want to make short-term shifts in asset allocation
               (Section 5), and how innate investor behaviors can interfere with successful long-term
               planning for the investment portfolio (Section 6). Throughout the reading, we illustrate

"Capital Market Expectations, Part I: Framework and Macro Considerations",Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," A noted investment authority has written that the “fundamental law of investing is
               the uncertainty of the future.”
                Investors have no choice but to forecast elements of the future because nearly all
               investment decisions look toward it. Specifically, investment decisions incorporate
               the decision maker’s expectations concerning factors and events believed to affect
               investment values. The decision maker integrates these views into expectations about
               the risk and return prospects of individual assets and groups of assets. This reading’s focus is capital market expectations (CME): expectations concerning the risk and return prospects of asset classes, however
               broadly or narrowly the investor defines those asset classes. Capital market expectations
               are an essential input to formulating a strategic asset allocation. For example, if
               an investor’s investment policy statement specifies and defines eight permissible
               asset classes, the investor will need to have formulated long-term expectations concerning
               each of those asset classes. The investor may also act on short-term expectations.
               Insights into capital markets gleaned during CME setting should also help in formulating
               the expectations concerning individual assets that are needed in security selection
               and valuation. This is the first of two readings on capital market expectations. A central theme
               of both readings is that a disciplined approach to setting expectations will be rewarded.
               With that in mind, Section 2 of this reading presents a general framework for developing
               capital market expectations and alerts the reader to the range of problems and pitfalls
               that await investors and analysts in this arena. Section 3 focuses on the use of macroeconomic
               analysis in setting expectations. The second of the two CME readings builds on this
               foundation to address setting expectations for specific asset classes: equities, fixed
               income, real estate, and currencies. Various analytical tools are reviewed as needed

 Curriculum",Level I," To build a suitable portfolio for a client, investment advisers should first seek
               to understand the client’s investment goals, resources, circumstances, and constraints.
               Investors can be categorized into broad groups based on shared characteristics with
               respect to these factors (e.g., various types of individual investors and institutional

The Behavioral Biases of Individuals,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," Much of traditional economic and financial theory is based on the assumptions that
individuals act rationally and consider all available information in the decision-making
process and that markets are efficient. Behavioral finance challenges these assumptions
and explores how individuals and markets actually behave. To differentiate the study
of individual investor behavior from the study of collective market behavior, the
subject of behavioral finance can be classified asBehavioral Finance Micro(BFMI) andBehavioral Finance Macro(BFMA). BFMI examines the behavioral biases that distinguish individual investors from the
rational decision makers of traditional finance. BFMA detects and describes market
anomalies that distinguish markets from the efficient markets of traditional finance.
In this reading, we focus on BFMI and the behavioral biases that individuals may exhibit
when making financial decisions. BFMI attempts to observe and explain how individuals
make financial decisions. This approach is in contrast to traditional theories of
financial decision making that describe how peopleshouldmake decisions under uncertainty. Many prominent researchers have demonstrated that when people are faced with complex
decision-making situations that demand substantial time and effort, they have difficulty
devising completely rational approaches to developing and analyzing various courses
of action. Facing uncertainty and an abundance of information to process, individuals
may not systematically describe problems, record necessary data, or synthesize information
to create rules for making decisions. Instead, individuals may follow a more subjective,
suboptimal path of reasoning to determine a course of action consistent with their
basic judgments and preferences. A decision maker may have neither the time nor the ability to arrive at a perfectly
optimal decision. Individuals strive to make good decisions by simplifying the choices
available, using a subset of the information available, and discarding some possible
alternatives to choose among a smaller number. They are content to accept a solution
that is “good enough” rather than attempting to find the optimal answer. In doing
so, they may unintentionally bias the decision-making process. These biases may lead
to irrational behaviors and decisions. By understanding behavioral biases, investment professionals may be able to improve
economic outcomes. This may entail identifying behavioral biases they themselves exhibit
or behavioral biases of others, including clients. Once a behavioral bias has been
identified, it may be possible to either moderate the bias or adapt to the bias so
that the resulting financial decisions more closely match the rational financial decisions
assumed by traditional finance. Knowledge of and integration of behavioral and traditional
finance may lead to superior results. Section 2 describes and broadly characterizes behavioral biases. Sections 3 and 4
discuss specific behavioral biases within two broad categories: cognitive errors and
emotional biases. The discussion will include a description of the bias, potential
consequences of the bias, detection of the bias, and guidance on moderating the effects
of the bias. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.  ","distinguish between cognitive errors and emotional biases;

Case Study in Risk Management: Private Wealth,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," Giving advice on risk management to individuals and families raises a number of challenges.
               These challenges include the extent to which identified and evaluated risks can be
               reduced and/or addressed using insurance policies or self-insurance. Families’ financial
               circumstances and risks evolve over time, and financial advisers should review and
               update the solutions addressing these risks accordingly. Risk management solutions
               recommended by advisers should consider the family’s overall health, wealth, and long-term
               goals. This case study explores some of the risk management issues for a married couple living
               in a hypothetical country in the Eurozone. The case spans several decades and follows
               the couple through different stages of life from their early career phase, when they
               are in their late twenties, all the way to retirement. We will show how risk management
               methods need to change as the family’s circumstances evolve. Particularly important
               prior readings related to this case are the Level III readings “Risk Management for
               Individuals” and “Overview of Private Wealth Management.” The assumptions used are drawn from what is typical for many countries in Europe.
               The circumstances and risks that this married couple face are influenced by the environment
               in which they find themselves. Despite the differences between Europe and other parts
               of the world, however, their goals, the risks they face, and the assessment of their
               circumstances, as well as the suggested methods, are by no means unique to the region.
               The risk analysis methodology and its application would therefore be valid in a much
               broader context. For simplicity, we assume that economic conditions and tax rates remain unchanged
               throughout the four decades that this case study spans. The terms “adviser” and “wealth
               manager” are used interchangeably throughout this case study. The amounts that appear
               in exhibits throughout the case study are rounded. The case is divided into six major sections. Section 2 provides background information
               about the hypothetical country in which the Schmitt family resides. Section 3 provides
               initial case facts relating to the family’s early career stage and risk management
               analysis, as well as solutions relevant to that stage. In Section 4, we revisit the
               couple in their career development stage when they are 45 years old. In Sections 5
               and 6, we examine their lives at age 55, in peak accumulation phase, and age 64, when
               they are preparing to retire. The final section provides a summary of the case.  ","identify and analyze a family’s risk exposures during the early career stage;

Analysis of Financial Institutions,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2021
 Curriculum",Level II," Financial institutions provide a wide range of financial products and services. They
               serve as intermediaries between providers and recipients of capital, facilitate asset
               and risk management, and execute transactions involving cash, securities, and other
               financial assets. Given the diversity of financial services, it is unsurprising that numerous types
               of financial institutions exist. Types of financial institutions include deposit-taking,
               loan-making institutions (referred to asbanksin this reading), investment banks, credit card companies, brokers, dealers, exchanges,
               clearing houses, depositories, investment managers, financial advisers, and insurance
               companies. In many situations, overlap of services exists across types of institutions.
               For example, banks not only take deposits and make loans but also may undertake investment
               management and other securities-related activities and may offer such products as
               derivatives, which are effectively insurance against adverse effects of movements
               in the interest rate, equity, and foreign currency markets. As another example of
               overlap, life insurance companies not only provide mortality-related insurance products
               but also offer savings vehicles. This reading focuses primarily on two types of financial
               institutions: banks (broadly defined as deposit-taking, loan-making institutions)
               and insurance companies. Section 2 explains what makes financial institutions different from other types of
               companies, such as manufacturers or merchandisers. Section 3 discusses how to analyze

Active Equity Investing: Portfolio Construction,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," Active equity investing is based on the concept that a skilled portfolio manager can
               both identify and differentiate between the most attractive securities and the least
               attractive securities—typically relative to a pre-specified benchmark. If this is
               the case, why is a portfolio—a collection of securities—even necessary? Why shouldn’t
               the portfolio manager just identify the most attractive security and invest all assets
               in this one security? Or in a long/short context, why not buy the “best” security
               and sell the “worst” one? Although very simple, this one-stock approach is not likely
               to be optimal or even feasible. No manager has perfect foresight, and his predictions
               will likely differ from realized returns. What he predicted would be the “best security”
               may quite likely turn outnotto be the best. Active equity portfolio managers, even those with great skill, cannot
               avoid this risk. Security analysis is the process for ranking the relative attractiveness
               of securities, whereas portfolio construction is about selecting the securities to
               be included and carefully determining what percentage of the portfolio is to be held
               in each security—balancing superior insights regarding predicted returns against some
               likelihood that these insights will be derailed by events unknown or simply prove
               to be inaccurate. Active managers rely on a wide array of investment strategies and methodologies to
               build portfolios of securities that they expect to outperform the benchmark. The challenges
               faced by active managers are similar whether they manage long-only traditional strategies,
               systematic/quantitative strategies, or long/short opportunistic strategies. Managers
               may differ in their investment style, operational complexity, flexibility of investment
               policy, ability to use leverage and short positions, and implementation methodologies,
               but predictions about returns and risk are essential to most active equity management
               styles. In Section 2, we introduce the “building blocks” of portfolio construction, and in
               Section 3, we discuss the different approaches to portfolio construction. In Sections
               4 and 5, we discuss risk budgeting concepts relevant to portfolio construction and
               the measures used to evaluate portfolio risk. Section 6 looks at how issues of scale
               may affect portfolio construction. Section 7 addresses the attributes of a well-constructed
               portfolio. Section 8 looks at certain specialized equity strategies and how their
               approaches to portfolio construction may differ from a long-only equity strategy.

Behavioral Finance and Investment Processes,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," Much of current economic and financial theory is based on the assumptions that individuals
               act rationally and consider all available information in the decision-making process.
                Behavioral finance challenges these assumptions. The relaxing of these assumptions
               has implications at both the individual and market levels. It is important to note
               that, at the individual level, all market participants, whether they are less knowledgeable
               individual investors or experienced money managers, may act irrationally; in other
               words, all market participants may deviate from the behavior that is assumed in traditional
               financial theory. Some of these deviations have been identified and categorized as
               behavioral biases. In addition, individual behavioral biases may be reinforced in
               a group setting, which further complicates rational investment processes. This reading focuses on understanding individual investor behavior and how it affects
               adviser–client relationships and portfolio construction, as well as on the analyst-,
               committee-, and market-level impact of behavioral biases. Section 2 discusses how
               investors may be classified by type based on the biases and other behaviors they display
               and explains the uses and limitations of classifying investors into types. Section
               3 discusses how behavioral factors affect adviser–client relationships. Section 4
               examines the potential effects of behavioral biases on portfolio construction. Section
               5 discusses how behavioral biases affect the work of analysts, looking specifically
               at their forecasts, and explores remedial actions for analyst biases. Section 6 examines
               committee decision making and how behavioral biases may be amplified or mitigated
               in a group setting, and discusses steps to make committees more effective. Section
               7 discusses how behavioral finance influences market behavior by examining market

Active Equity Investing: Strategies,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," This reading provides an overview of active equity investing and the major types of
               active equity strategies. The reading is organized around a classification of active
               equity strategies into two broad approaches: fundamental and quantitative. Both approaches
               aim at outperforming a passive benchmark (for example, a broad equity market index),
               but they tend to make investment decisions differently. Fundamental approaches stress
               the use of human judgment in processing information and making investment decisions,
               whereas quantitative approaches tend to rely more heavily on rules-based quantitative
               models. As a result, some practitioners and academics refer to the fundamental, judgment-based
               approaches as “discretionary” and to the rules-based, quantitative approaches as “systematic.” This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces fundamental and quantitative
               approaches to active management. Section 3 discusses bottom-up, top-down, factor-based,
               and activist investing strategies. Section 4 describes the process of creating fundamental
               active investment strategies, including the parameters to consider as well as some
               of the pitfalls. Section 5 describes the steps required to create quantitative active
               investment strategies, as well as the pitfalls in a quantitative investment process.
               Section 6 discusses style classifications of active strategies and the uses and limitations

Applications of Financial Statement Analysis,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2021
 Curriculum",Level I," This reading presents several important applications of financial statement analysis.
               Among the issues we will address are the following: The reading “Financial Statement Analysis: An Introduction” described a framework
               for conducting financial statement analysis. Consistent with that framework, prior
               to undertaking any analysis, an analyst should explore the purpose and context of
               the analysis. The purpose and context guide further decisions about the approach,
               the tools, the data sources, and the format in which to report results of the analysis,
               and also suggest which aspects of the analysis are most important. Having identified
               the purpose and context, the analyst should then be able to formulate the key questions
               that the analysis must address. The questions will suggest the data the analyst needs
               to collect to objectively address the questions. The analyst then processes and analyzes
               the data to answer these questions. Conclusions and decisions based on the analysis
               are communicated in a format appropriate to the context, and follow-up is undertaken
               as required. Although this reading will not formally present applications as a series
               of steps, the process just described is generally applicable. Section 2 of this reading describes the use of financial statement analysis to evaluate
               a company’s past financial performance, and Section 3 describes basic approaches to
               projecting a company’s future financial performance. Section 4 presents the use of
               financial statement analysis in assessing the credit quality of a potential debt investment.
               Section 5 concludes the survey of applications by describing the use of financial
               statement analysis in screening for potential equity investments. Analysts often encounter
               situations in which they must make adjustments to a company’s reported financial results
               to increase their accuracy or comparability with the financials of other companies.
               Section 6 illustrates several common types of analyst adjustments. Section 7 presents
               a summary, and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple-choice format conclude

Asset Allocation to Alternative Investments,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," Asset allocation is a critical decision in the investment process. The mathematical
and analytical processes inherent in contemporary asset allocation techniques are
complicated by the idiosyncrasies of alternative investments. Approaches to incorporating
alternative assets into the strategic asset allocation have developed rapidly as allocations
to assets other than stocks and bonds have accelerated in the aftermath of the 2008
Global Financial Crisis. The term “alternative” understates the prominence of alternative
investment allocations in many investment programs, because institutional and private
clients have been increasingly turning to these investments not just to supplement
traditional long-only stocks and bonds but also sometimes to replace them altogether.
For example, the Yale Endowment and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board both
have close to 50% of their assets allocated to alternatives.
Although these two funds are admittedly outliers, between 2008 and 2017 most of the
pension funds around the world substantially expanded their allocations to alternative
asset classes. On average, pension funds in developed markets increased their allocation
from 7.2% to 11.8% of assets under management (AUM) in 2017, a 63% increase. “Alternative” investment has no universally accepted definition. For the purposes
of this reading, alternative investments include private equity, hedge funds, real
assets (including energy and commodity investments), commercial real estate, and private
credit. The reading begins with a discussion of the role alternative assets play in a multi-asset
portfolio and explores how alternatives may serve to mitigate long-only equity risk,
a role traditionally held by bonds. We then consider different ways investors may
define the opportunity set—through the traditional asset class lens or, more recently,
using a risk- or factor-based lens. An allocation to alternatives is not for all investors,
so the reading describes issues that should be addressed when considering an allocation
to alternatives. We then discuss approaches to asset allocation when incorporating
alternatives in the opportunity set and the need for liquidity planning in private
investment alternatives. Finally, the reading discusses the unique monitoring requirements
for an alternatives portfolio.  ","explain the roles that alternative investments play in multi-asset portfolios;

Case Study in Portfolio Management: Institutional,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2021
 Curriculum",Level III," The development of a strategic asset allocation (SAA) for long-horizon institutional
               investors like university endowments raises special challenges. These include supporting
               spending policies while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the endowment and
               establishing optimal exposure to illiquid investment strategies in the context of
               a diversified portfolio. Large university endowments typically have significant exposure to illiquid asset
               classes. The exposure to illiquid asset classes impacts the portfolio’s overall liquidity
               profile and requires a comprehensive liquidity management approach to ensure liquidity
               needs can be met in a timely fashion.
                In addition, capital market conditions and asset prices change, resulting in a need
               to change asset allocation exposures and/or rebalance the portfolio to maintain a
               profile close to the strategic asset allocation. Derivatives are often used by institutions to manage liquidity needs and implement
               asset allocation changes. The cash-efficient nature of derivatives and their high
               levels of liquidity in many markets make them suitable tools for portfolio rebalancing,
               tactical exposure changes, and satisfying short-term liquidity needs—all while maintaining
               desired portfolio exposures. This case study explores these issues from the perspective of a large university endowment
               undertaking a review of its asset allocation and then implementing proposed allocation
               changes and a tactical overlay program. Rebalancing needs for the endowment arise
               as market moves result in drift of the endowment’s asset allocation. The case is divided into two major sections. The first section addresses issues relating
               to asset allocation and liquidity management. The case introduces a framework to support
               management of liquidity and cash needs in an orderly and timely manner while avoiding
               disruption to underlying managers and potentially capturing an illiquidity premium.
               Such concepts as time-to-cash tables and liquidity budgets are explored in detail.
               Aspects relating to rebalancing and maintaining a risk profile similar to the portfolio’s
               strategic asset allocation over time are also covered. The second section explores the use of derivatives in portfolio construction from
               a tactical asset allocation (TAA) overlay and rebalancing perspective. The suitability
               of futures, total return swaps, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is discussed based
               on their characteristics, associated costs, and desired portfolio objectives. The
               case also presents a cost–benefit analysis of derivatives and cash markets for implementing
               rebalancing decisions.  ","discuss tools for managing portfolio liquidity risk;

Backtesting & Simulation,Quantitative Methods,"2021
 Curriculum",Level II," This reading provides an overview of backtesting and simulation of investment strategies. Backtesting and related techniques enable investment practitioners to simulate the performance of investment strategies (especially quantitative strategies) using historical data or data derived from the distributions of historical data, to generate test results, and to analyze risk and return, without investing any real capital in the strategies. The rise of big data and the increase in computing power have spurred the development and spread of quantitative investing. Almost every major data vendor has available tools that make systematic backtesting and simulation increasingly accessible. Off-the-shelf software allows backtesting and simulation of endless combinations of possible investment strategies, formulation of multifactor models, and construction of investable portfolios. Developing quantitative investment strategies may appear relatively straightforward, but in reality, it is not. However, understanding the steps and procedures, the implicit assumptions, the pitfalls, and the interpretation of results in backtesting and simulation is a prerequisite for proper utilization of these tools and successful development and implementation of investment strategies. In a CFA Institute survey of nearly 250 analysts, portfolio managers, and private wealth managers on quantitative investment techniques, 50% of respondents reported that they had conducted backtesting of an investment strategy within the past 12 months of the survey date. This result underscores the importance of backtesting (and other simulation techniques) for investors in practice, and this reading is a starting point on the journey to building this core professional competency.

Big Data Projects,Quantitative Methods,"2020
 Curriculum",Level II," Big data (also referred to as alternative data) encompasses data generated by financial markets (e.g., stock and bond prices), businesses (e.g., company financials, production volumes), governments (e.g., economic and trade data), individuals (e.g., credit card purchases, social media posts), sensors (e.g., satellite imagery, traffic patterns), and the Internet of Things, or IoT, (i.e., the network of interrelated digital devices that can transfer data among themselves without human interaction). A veritable explosion in big data has occurred over the past decade or so, especially in unstructured data generated from social media (e.g., posts, tweets, blogs), email and text communications, web traffic, online news sites, electronic images, and other electronic information sources. The prospects are for exponential growth in big data to continue. Investment managers are increasingly using big data in their investment processes as they strive to discover signals embedded in such data that can provide them with an information edge. They seek to augment structured data with a plethora of unstructured data to develop improved forecasts of trends in asset prices, detect anomalies, etc. A typical example involves a fund manager using financial text data from 10-K reports for forecasting stock sentiment (i.e., positive or negative), which can then be used as an input to a more comprehensive forecasting model that includes corporate financial data. Unlike structured data (numbers and values) that can be readily organized into data tables to be read and analyzed by computers, unstructured data typically require specific methods of preparation and refinement before being usable by machines (i.e., computers) and useful to investment professionals. Given the volume, variety, and velocity of available big data, it is important for portfolio managers and investment analysts to have a basic understanding of how unstructured data can be transformed into structured data suitable as inputs to machine learning (ML) methods (in fact, for any type of modeling methods) that can potentially improve their financial forecasts. This reading describes the steps in using big data, both structured and unstructured, in financial forecasting. The concepts and methods are then demonstrated in a case study of an actual big data project. The project uses text-based data derived from financial documents to train an ML model to classify text into positive or negative sentiment classes for the respective stocks and then to predict sentiment. Section 2 of the reading covers a description of the key characteristics of big data. Section 3 provides an overview of the steps in executing a financial forecasting project using big data. We then describe in Sections 4–6 key aspects of data preparation and wrangling, data exploration, and model training using structured data and unstructured (textual) data. In Section 7, we bring these pieces together by covering the execution of an actual big data project. A summary in Section 8 concludes the reading.

Big Data Projects,Quantitative Methods,"2020
 Curriculum",Level II," Big data (also referred to as alternative data) encompasses data generated by financial markets (e.g., stock and bond prices), businesses (e.g., company financials, production volumes), governments (e.g., economic and trade data), individuals (e.g., credit card purchases, social media posts), sensors (e.g., satellite imagery, traffic patterns), and the Internet of Things, or IoT, (i.e., the network of interrelated digital devices that can transfer data among themselves without human interaction). A veritable explosion in big data has occurred over the past decade or so, especially in unstructured data generated from social media (e.g., posts, tweets, blogs), email and text communications, web traffic, online news sites, electronic images, and other electronic information sources. The prospects are for exponential growth in big data to continue. Investment managers are increasingly using big data in their investment processes as they strive to discover signals embedded in such data that can provide them with an information edge. They seek to augment structured data with a plethora of unstructured data to develop improved forecasts of trends in asset prices, detect anomalies, etc. A typical example involves a fund manager using financial text data from 10-K reports for forecasting stock sentiment (i.e., positive or negative), which can then be used as an input to a more comprehensive forecasting model that includes corporate financial data. Unlike structured data (numbers and values) that can be readily organized into data tables to be read and analyzed by computers, unstructured data typically require specific methods of preparation and refinement before being usable by machines (i.e., computers) and useful to investment professionals. Given the volume, variety, and velocity of available big data, it is important for portfolio managers and investment analysts to have a basic understanding of how unstructured data can be transformed into structured data suitable as inputs to machine learning (ML) methods (in fact, for any type of modeling methods) that can potentially improve their financial forecasts. This reading describes the steps in using big data, both structured and unstructured, in financial forecasting. The concepts and methods are then demonstrated in a case study of an actual big data project. The project uses text-based data derived from financial documents to train an ML model to classify text into positive or negative sentiment classes for the respective stocks and then to predict sentiment. Section 2 of the reading covers a description of the key characteristics of big data. Section 3 provides an overview of the steps in executing a financial forecasting project using big data. We then describe in Sections 4–6 key aspects of data preparation and wrangling, data exploration, and model training using structured data and unstructured (textual) data.

Test 20 Cost of Capital,Corporate Finance,"2020
 Curriculum",Level I," A company grows by making investments that are expected to increase revenues and profits. The company acquires the capital or funds necessary to make such investments by borrowing or using funds from owners. By applying this capital to investments with long-term benefits, the company is producing value today. But, how much value? The answer depends not only on the investments’ expected future cash flows but also on the cost of the funds. Borrowing is not costless. Neither is using owners’ funds. The cost of this capital is an important ingredient in both investment decision making by the company’s management and the valuation of the company by investors. If a company invests in projects that produce a return in excess of the cost of capital, the company has created value; in contrast, if the company invests in projects whose returns are less than the cost of capital, the company has actually destroyed value. Therefore, the estimation of the cost of capital is a central issue in corporate financial management. For the analyst seeking to evaluate a company’s investment program and its competitive position, an accurate estimate of a company’s cost of capital is important as well. Cost of capital estimation is a challenging task. As we have already implied, the cost of capital is not observable but, rather, must be estimated. Arriving at a cost of capital estimate requires a host of assumptions and estimates. Another challenge is that the cost of capital that is appropriately applied to a specific investment depends on the characteristics of that investment: The riskier the investment’s cash flows, the greater its cost of capital. In reality, a company must estimate project-specific costs of capital. What is often done, however, is to estimate the cost of capital for the company as a whole and then adjust this overall corporate cost of capital upward or downward to reflect the risk of the contemplated project relative to the company’s average project. This reading is organized as follows: In the next section, we introduce the cost of capital and its basic computation. Section 3 presents a selection of methods for estimating the costs of the various sources of capital. Section 4 discusses issues an analyst faces in using the cost of capital. A summary concludes the reading.  ","calculate and interpret the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of a company;

Exchange Traded Funds: Mechanics and Applications,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2020
 Curriculum",Level II," Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown rapidly since their invention in the early 1990s, in large part because of their low associated cost, exchange access, holdings transparency, and range of asset classes available. Growth in ETFs has also been driven by the increased use of index-based investing. ETF investors need to understand how these products work and trade and how to choose from the numerous options available. Although many ETFs are organized under the same regulation as mutual fund products, there are important differences related to trading and tax efficiency. ETFs have features that can make them more tax efficient than traditional mutual funds, and not all ETFs are organized like mutual funds. ETFs can be based on derivative strategies, use leverage and shorting, and be offered in alternate structures, such as exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which have their own unique risks. Understanding how ETF shares are created and redeemed is key to understanding how these products can add value in a portfolio. Since so many ETFs track indexes, understanding their index tracking or tracking error is also critical. Investors should also understand how to assess an ETF’s trading costs, including differences between the ETF’s market price and the fair value of its portfolio holdings. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses ETF primary and secondary markets, including the creation/redemption process. Section 3 covers important investor considerations, such as costs and risks, when choosing an ETF. Section 4 explains how ETFs are used in strategic, tactical, and portfolio efficiency applications. Section 5 concludes and summarizes the reading.  ","explain the creation/redemption process of ETFs and the function of authorized participants;

Evaluating Quality of Financial Reports,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2020
 Curriculum",Level II," The ability to assess the quality of reported financial information can be a valuable skill. An analyst or investor who can recognize high-quality financial reporting can have greater confidence in analysis based on those financial reports and the resulting investment decisions. Similarly, an analyst or investor who can recognize poor financial reporting quality early—before deficiencies become widely known—is more likely to make profitable investment decisions or to reduce or even avoid losses. An example of early recognition of an ultimate financial disaster is James Chanos’ short position in Enron in November 2000—more than a year before Enron filed for bankruptcy protection (in December 2001). Despite Enron’s high profile and reputation, Chanos had a negative view of Enron based on both quantitative and qualitative factors. Chanos noted that Enron’s return on capital was both lower than comparable companies’ return on capital and lower than the company’s own cost of capital. Qualitative factors contributing to Chanos’ view included the company’s aggressive revenue recognition policy, its complex and difficult-to-understand disclosures on related-party transactions, and one-time earnings-boosting gains. Later events that substantiated Chanos’ perspective included sales of the company’s stock by insiders and the resignation of senior executives. Another example of early recognition of eventual financial troubles is June 2001 reports by analyst Enitan Adebonojo. These reports highlighted questionable accounting by Royal Ahold, a European food retailer. The questionable accounting included “claiming profits of acquired firms as ‘organic growth,’ booking capital gains from sale-and-leaseback deals as profit, and keeping billions in debt off its balance sheet.” In 2003, Royal Ahold announced that it had significantly overstated its profits in the prior two years. The CEO and CFO resigned, various regulators announced investigations, and Royal Ahold’s market value dropped significantly. This reading focuses on reporting quality and the interrelated attribute of results quality.Reporting qualitypertains to the information disclosed in financial reports. High-quality reporting provides decision-useful information—information that is relevant and faithfully represents the economic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period and the company’s financial condition at the end of the period. A separate, but interrelated, attribute of quality isresultsorearnings quality, which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition relative to expectations of current and future financial performance. Note that the term “earnings quality” is more commonly used in practice than “results quality,” so throughout this reading, earnings quality is used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, and/or balance sheet items. High-quality earnings reflect an adequate level of return on investment and are derived from activities that a company will likely be able to sustain in the future. Thus, high-quality earnings increase the value of a company more than low-quality earnings. When reported earnings are described as being high quality, it means that the company’s underlying economic performance was good (i.e., value enhancing), and it also implies that the company had high reporting quality (i.e., that the information that the company calculated and disclosed was a good reflection of the economic reality). Earnings can be termed “low quality” either because the reported information properly represents genuinely bad performance or because the reported information misrepresents economic reality. In theory, a company could have low-quality earnings while simultaneously having high reporting quality. Consider a company with low-quality earnings—for example, one whose only source of earnings in a period is a one-off settlement of a lawsuit without which the company would have reported huge losses. The company could nonetheless have high reporting quality if it calculated its results properly and provided decision-useful information. Although it is theoretically possible that a company could have low-quality earnings while simultaneously having high reporting quality, experiencing poor financial performance can motivate the company’s management to misreport. This reading begins in Section 2 with a description of a conceptual framework for and potential problems with financial reporting quality. This is followed in Section 3 with a discussion of how to evaluate financial reporting quality. Sections 4, 5, and 6 focus on the quality of reported earnings, cash flows, and balance sheets, respectively. Section 7 covers sources of information about risk. A summary and practice problems in the CFA Institute item set format complete the reading.

Industry and Company Analysis (2018),Equity Investments,"2018
 Curriculum",Level II," This reading explores industry and company analysis with a focus on how analysts use industry information and corporate disclosures to forecast a company’s future financial results. Financial forecasts are the basis for fundamental equity valuation based on discounted cash flows and/or market multiples. An effective forecast model must be based on a thorough understanding of a company’s business, management, strategy, external environment, and historical results. Thus an analyst begins with a review of the company and its environment—its industry, key products, strategic position, management, competitors, suppliers, and customers. Using this information, an analyst identifies key revenue and cost drivers and assesses the likely impact of relevant trends, such as economic conditions and technological developments. An analyst’s understanding of the fundamental drivers of the business and an assessment of future events provides a basis for developing inputs to the forecast model. This reading begins with an overview of developing a forecast model. Section 2 describes the general approach to forecasting each component of the income statement (revenue, operating costs, and non-operating costs), balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The next sections develop special topics: Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 describe, respectively, the impact of competitive factors on prices and costs; the effects of inflation and deflation; technological developments; long-term forecasting; and building a company model. Section 8 presents conclusions and a summary.  ","compare top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches for developing inputs to equity valuation models;

Discounted Dividend Valuation (2018),Equity Investments,"2018
 Curriculum",Level II," Common stock represents an ownership interest in a business. A business in its operations generates a stream of cash flows, and as owners of the business, common stockholders have an equity ownership claim on those future cash flows. Beginning with John Burr Williams (1938), analysts have developed this insight into a group of valuation models known as discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models. DCF models—which view the intrinsic value of common stock as the present value of its expected future cash flows—are a fundamental tool in both investment management and investment research. This reading is the first of several that describe DCF models and address how to apply those models in practice. Although the principles behind discounted cash flow valuation are simple, applying the theory to equity valuation can be challenging. Four broad steps in applying DCF analysis to equity valuation are: In this reading, we take the perspective that dividends—distributions to shareholders authorized by a company’s board of directors—are an appropriate definition of cash flows. The class of models based on this idea is called dividend discount models, or DDMs. The basic objective of any DDM is to value a stock. The variety of implementations corresponds to different ways to model a company’s future stream of dividend payments. The steps of choosing a discount rate methodology and estimating the discount rate involve the same considerations for all DCF models, so they have been presented separately in a reading on return concepts. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of present value models. A general statement of the dividend discount model follows in Section 3. Forecasting dividends, individually and in detail, into the indefinite future is not generally practicable, so the dividend-forecasting problem is usually simplified. One approach is to assign dividends to a stylized growth pattern. The simplest pattern—dividends growing at a constant rate forever—is the constant growth (or Gordon growth) model, discussed in Section 4. For some companies, it is more appropriate to view earnings and dividends as having multiple stages of growth; multistage dividend discount models are presented in Section 5 along with spreadsheet modeling. Section 6 lays out the determinants of dividend growth rates, and the final section summarizes the reading.  ","compare dividends, free cash flow, and residual income as inputs to discounted cash flow models and identify investment situations for which each measure is suitable;

The Portfolio Management Process and the Investment Policy Statement (2018),Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"2018
 Curriculum",Level II," In setting out to master the concepts and tools of portfolio management, we first need
a coherent description of the portfolio management process. The portfolio management process is an integrated set of steps undertaken in a consistent manner to create
and maintain an appropriate portfolio (combination of assets) to meet clients’ stated
goals. The process we present in this reading is a distillation of the shared elements
of current practice. Because it serves as the foundation for the process, we also introduce the investment
policy statement through a discussion of its main components. An investment policy
statement (IPS) is a written document that clearly sets out a client’s return objectives
and risk tolerance over that client’s relevant time horizon, along with applicable
constraints such as liquidity needs, tax considerations, regulatory requirements, and
unique circumstances. The portfolio management process moves from planning, through execution,
and then to feedback. In the planning step, investment objectives and policies are
formulated, capital market expectations are formed, and strategic asset allocations
are established. In the execution step, the portfolio manager constructs the portfolio.
In the feedback step, the manager monitors and evaluates the portfolio compared
with the plan. Any changes suggested by the feedback must be examined carefully to
ensure that they represent long-run considerations. The investment policy statement provides the foundation of the portfolio management process. In creating an IPS, the manager writes down the client’s special
characteristics and needs. The IPS must clearly communicate the client’s objectives
and constraints. The IPS thereby becomes a plan that can be executed by any advisor or portfolio manager the client might subsequently hire. A properly developed
IPS disciplines the portfolio management process and helps ensure against ad hoc
revisions in strategy. When combined with capital market expectations, the IPS forms the basis for a
strategic asset allocation. Capital market expectations concern the risk and return
characteristics of capital market instruments such as stocks and bonds. The strategic
asset allocation establishes acceptable exposures to IPS-permissible asset classes to
achieve the client’s long-run objectives and constraints. The portfolio perspective underlies the portfolio management process and IPS.
The next sections illustrate this perspective.  ","explain the importance of the portfolio perspective;
describe the steps of the portfolio management process and the
components of those steps;
explain the role of the investment policy statement in the
portfolio management process and describe the elements of an
investment policy statement;

Employee Compensation: Post-Employment and Share-Based (2018),Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2018
 Curriculum",Level III," This reading covers two complex aspects of employee compensation: post- employment (retirement) benefits and share- based compensation. Retirement benefits include pensions and other post- employment benefits, such as health insurance. Examples of share- based compensation are stock options and stock grants. A common issue underlying both of these aspects of employee compensation is the difficulty in measuring the value of the compensation. One factor contributing to the difficulty is that employees earn the benefits in the periods that they provide service but typically receive the benefits in future periods, so measurement requires a significant number of assumptions. This reading provides an overview of the methods companies use to estimate and measure the benefits they provide to their employees and how this informa-tion is reported in financial statements. There has been some convergence between International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted account-ing principles (US GAAP) in the measurement and accounting treatment for pensions, other post- employment benefits, and share- based compensation, but some differences remain. Although this reading focuses on IFRS as the basis for discussion, instances where US GAAP significantly differ are discussed. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 addresses pensions and other post-employment benefits, and Section 3 covers share- based compensation with a primary focus on the accounting for and analysis of stock options.

Integration of Financial Statement Analysis Techniques (2018),Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2018
 Curriculum",Level II," It is important to keep in mind that financial analysis is a means to an end and not the end itself. Rather than try to apply every possible technique and tool to every situation, it is essential for the investor to consider and identify the proper type of analysis to apply in a given situation. The primary reason for performing financial analysis is to help in making an economic decision. Before making such decisions as whether to lend to a particular long-term borrower or to invest a large sum in a common stock, venture capital vehicle, or private equity candidate, an investor or financial decision-maker wants to make sure that the probability of a successful outcome is on his or her side. Rather than leave outcomes to chance, a financial decision-maker should use financial analysis to identify and make more visible potential favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The purpose of this reading is to provide examples of the effective use of financial analysis in decision making. The framework for the analysis is shown in Exhibit 1. Each case study is set in a different type of company and has a different focus/purpose and context for the analysis. However, each case study follows the basic framework shown in Exhibit 1.  ","demonstrate the use of a framework for the analysis of financial statements, given a particular problem, question, or purpose (e.g., valuing equity based on comparables, critiquing a credit rating, obtaining a comprehensive picture of financial leverage, evaluating the perspectives given in management’s discussion of financial results);

Free Cash Flow Valuation (2018),Equity Investments,"2018
 Curriculum",Level II," Discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation views the intrinsic value of a security as the
present value of its expected future cash flows. When applied to dividends, the DCF
model is the discounted dividend approach or dividend discount model (DDM). This
reading extends DCF analysis to value a company and its equity securities by valuing
free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE). Whereas dividends
are the cash flows actually paid to stockholders, free cash flows are the cash
flowsavailablefor distribution to shareholders. Unlike dividends, FCFF and FCFE are not readily available data. Analysts need to
compute these quantities from available financial information, which requires a clear
understanding of free cash flows and the ability to interpret and use the information
correctly. Forecasting future free cash flows is also a rich and demanding exercise.
The analyst’s understanding of a company’s financial statements, its operations, its
financing, and its industry can pay real “dividends” as he or she addresses that task.
Many analysts consider free cash flow models to be more useful than DDMs in practice.
Free cash flows provide an economically sound basis for valuation. Analysts like to use free cash flow as the return (either FCFF or FCFE) whenever
one or more of the following conditions is present: Common equity can be valued directly by using FCFE or indirectly by first using a
FCFF model to estimate the value of the firm and then subtracting the value of noncommon-stock
capital (usually debt) from FCFF to arrive at an estimate of the value
of equity. The purpose of this reading is to develop the background required to use
the FCFF or FCFE approaches to value a company’s equity. Section 2 defines the concepts of free cash flow to the firm and free cash flow to
equity and then presents the two valuation models based on discounting of FCFF and
FCFE. We also explore the constant-growth models for valuing FCFF and FCFE, which
are special cases of the general models, in this section. After reviewing the FCFF and
FCFE valuation process in Section 2, we turn in Section 3 to the vital task of calculating and forecasting FCFF and FCFE. Section 4 explains multistage free cash flow
valuation models and presents some of the issues associated with their application.
Analysts usually value operating assets and nonoperating assets separately and then
combine them to find the total value of the firm, an approach described in Section 5.  ","compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow

Market-Based Valuation: Price and Enterprise Value Multiples (2018),Equity Investments,"2018
 Curriculum",Level II," Among the most familiar and widely used valuation tools are price and enterprise value multiples.Price multiplesare ratios of a stock’s market price to some measure of fundamental value per share.Enterprise value multiples, by contrast, relate the total market value of all sources of a company’s capital to a measure of fundamental value for the entire company. The intuition behind price multiples is that investors evaluate the price of a share of stock—judge whether it is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued—by considering what a share buys in terms of per share earnings, net assets, cash flow or some other measure of value (stated on a per share basis). The intuition behind enterprise value multiples is similar; investors evaluate the market value of an entire enterprise relative to the amount of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), sales, or operating cash flow it generates. As valuation indicators (measures or indicators of value), multiples have the appealing qualities of simplicity in use and ease in communication. A multiple summarizes in a single number the relationship between the market value of a company’s stock (or of its total capital) and some fundamental quantity, such as earnings, sales, orbook value(owners’ equity based on accounting values). Among the questions we will study in this reading for answers that will help in making correct use of multiples as valuation tools are the following: Multiples may be viewed as valuation indicators relating to individual securities. Another type of valuation indicator used in securities selection ismomentum indicators. They typically relate either price or a fundamental (such as earnings) to the time series of its own past values or, in some cases, to its expected value. The logic behind the use of momentum indicators is that such indicators may provide infor-mation on future patterns of returns over some time horizon. Because the purpose of momentum indicators is to identify potentially rewarding investment opportunities, they can be viewed as a class of valuation indicators with a focus that is different from and complementary to the focus of price and enterprise value multiples. This reading is organized as follows. In Section 2, we put the use of price and enterprise value multiples in an economic context and present certain themes common to the use of any price or enterprise value multiple. Section 3 presents price multiples; a subsection is devoted to each multiple. The treatment of each multiple follows a common format: usage considerations, the relationship of the multiple to investors’ expectations about fundamentals, and using the multiple in valuation based on comparables. Section 4 presents enterprise value multiples and is organized similarly to Section 3. Section 5 presents international considerations in using multiples. A treatment of momentum indicators follows in Section 6. Section 7 discusses several practical issues that arise in using valuation indicators. We then summarize the reading, and the reading concludes with practice problems.

Residual Income Valuation (2018),Equity Investments,"2018
 Curriculum",Level II," Residual income models of equity value have become widely recognized tools in both investment practice and research. Conceptually, residual income is net income less a charge (deduction) for common shareholders’ opportunity cost in generating net income. It is the residual or remaining income after considering the costs of all of a company’s capital. The appeal of residual income models stems from a shortcoming of traditional accounting. Specifically, although a company’s income statement includes a charge for the cost of debt capital in the form of interest expense, it does not include a charge for the cost of equity capital. A company can have positive net income but may still not be adding value for shareholders if it does not earn more than its cost of equity capital. Residual income models explicitly recognize the costs of all the capital used in generating income. As an economic concept, residual income has a long history, dating back to Alfred Marshall in the late 1800s.1As far back as the 1920s, General Motors used the concept in evaluating business segments.2More recently, residual income has received renewed attention and interest, sometimes under names such as economic profit, abnormal earnings, or economic value added. Although residual income concepts have been used in a variety of contexts, including the measurement of internal corporate performance, this reading will focus on the residual income model for estimating the intrinsic value of common stock. Among the questions we will study to help us apply residual income models are the following: The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 develops the concept of residual income, introduces the use of residual income in valuation, and briefly presents alternative measures used in practice. Section 3 presents the residual income model and illustrates its use in valuing common stock. This section also shows practical applications, including the single-stage (constant-growth) residual income model and a multistage residual income model. Section 4 describes the relative strengths and weaknesses of residual income valuation compared to other valuation methods. Section 5 addresses accounting issues in the use of residual income valuation. The final section summarizes the reading and practice problems conclude. 1 Alfred Marshall, Book Two: Some Fundamental Notions, Chapter 4, “Income, Capital,” in Principles of Economics (London; Macmillan and Co., Ltd., 1890).2 See, for example, Young (1999) and Lo and Lys (2000).

Yield-Based Bond Convexity and Portfolio Properties,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I,"While duration is a linear approximation of the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in yield, the true relationship between a bond’s price and its yield-to-maturity is a curved (convex) line. We introduce convexity as a complementary risk measure to improve bond price change estimates based on modified duration alone to account for this non-linear relationship. The convexity adjustment becomes more important when considering larger moves in yield-to-maturity and longer-maturity bonds. These lessons will also show how to estimate duration and convexity for a portfolio of bonds, as well as highlight limitations due to underlying assumptions.

Forward Commitment and Contingent Claim Features and Instruments​,Derivatives,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I,"An earlier lesson established a derivative as a financial instrument that derives its performance from an underlying asset, index, or other financial variable, such as equity price volatility. Primary derivative types include a firm commitment in which a predetermined amount is agreed to be exchanged between counterparties at settlement and a contingent claim in which one of the counterparties determines whether and when the trade will settle. The following lessons define and compare the basic features of forward commitments and contingent claims and explain how to calculate their values at maturity.

Pricing and Valuation of Futures Contracts,Derivatives,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Many of the pricing and valuation principles associated with forward commitments are common to both forward and futures contracts. For example, previous lessons demonstrated that forward commitments have a price that prevents market participants from earning riskless profit through arbitrage. It was also shown that long and short forward commitments may be replicated using a combination of long or short cash positions and borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate. Finally, both forward and futures pricing and valuation incorporate the cost of carry, or the benefits and costs of owning an underlying asset over the life of a derivative contract. We now turn our attention to futures contracts. We discuss what distinguishes them from other forward commitments and how they are used by issuers and investors. We expand upon the daily settlement of futures contract gains and losses introduced earlier and explain the differences between forwards and futures. We also address and distinguish the interest rate futures market and its role in interest rate derivative contracts.  ","compare the value and price of forward and futures contracts

Business Models & Risks,Corporate Finance,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," A clearly described business model helps the analyst understand a business, including how it operates, its strategy, target customers, key partners, prospects, risks, and financial profile. Rather than rely on management’s description of its business model, analysts should develop their own understanding. Many firms have conventional business models that are easily understood and described in simple terms, such as manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, professional firm, or restaurant chain. However, many business models are complex, specialized, or new. Digital technology, in particular, has enabled significant business model innovation, bringing business models into the spotlight. It has spawned new services and markets and has changed the way most businesses operate. In many cases, technology has enabled the disruption of existing business models, allowing new players to win against large and well-established players who lack the capabilities or agility to respond.

Capital Investments,Corporate Finance,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Capital investments, also referred to as capital projects, are investments with a life of one year or longer made by corporate issuers. Issuers make capital investments to generate value for their stakeholders by returning long-term benefits and future cash flows greater than the associated funding cost of the capital invested. How companies allocate capital between competing priorities and the resulting capital investment portfolio are central to a company’s success and together constitute a fundamental area for analysts to understand. Given that corporate disclosure of capital investments typically is given at a very high level and often lacks specifics, the evaluation of a company’s capital investments is often challenging for analysts. Capital investments describe a company’s future prospects better than its working capital or capital structure, which are often similar for companies, and provide insight into the quality of management’s decisions and how the company is creating value for stakeholders. Although the focus of this coverage is on capital investments, companies also make other investments in increased working capital, information technology (IT), and human resources projects. These investments might not be capitalized and therefore affect near-term operating profit, but they are made for similar long-term benefit as capital investments.

Interest Rate Risk and Return,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I,"Prior lessons on yield measures established that a fixed-income investor’s rate of return will equal a bond’s yield-to-maturity (YTM) under certain assumptions. In these lessons, we explore the sources of return for fixed-income investments and demonstrate investment returns in different scenarios, including the one embedded in the YTM calculations. Prior lessons also established interest rate risk. We show how investment horizon, in relation to a bond’s features, is a key determinant of interest rate risk for investors and how different investors in the same fixed-income invest- ment can have different returns and views on risk. Finally, we introduce Macaulay duration, a weighted-average measure of the time to receipt for a bond’s cash flows, and demonstrate how holding a bond for its Macaulay duration balances reinvestment and price risks.

This lesson and those that follow extend that discussion by introducing measures of price risk. Two broad categories of such measures exist: those that assume underlying bond cash flows are certain and measure price sensitivity to changes in a bond’s own yield, which are covered in these lessons, and those that introduce the possibility of a bond default and that measure price sensitivity to changes in a benchmark yield curve, which are covered in later lessons.

Introduction to Geopolitics,Economics,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," The international environment is constantly evolving. Such trends as the growth of emerging market economies, globalization, and the rise of populism impact the range of opportunities and threats that companies, industries, nations, and regional groups face. They can be impacted by changes in regulation, disrupted trade flows, or even conflict. Geopolitics is the study of how geography affects politics and international relations. Within the field of geopolitics, analysts study actors—the individuals, organizations, companies, and national governments that carry out political, economic, and financial activities—and how they interact with one another. These relations matter for investments because they contribute to important drivers of investment performance, including economic growth, business performance, market volatility, and transaction costs. Geopolitical risk is the risk associated with tensions or actions between actors that affect the normal and peaceful course of international relations. Geopolitical risk tends to rise when the geographic and political factors underpinning country relations shift. A shift could arise from a change in policy, a natural disaster, a terrorist act, a theft, or war. Investors study geopolitical risk because it has a tangible impact on investment outcomes. On a macroeconomic level, these risks impact capital markets conditions, including economic growth, interest rates, and market volatility. Changes in capital markets conditions can, in turn, have an important influence on asset allocation decisions, including an investor’s choice of geographic exposure. On a portfolio level, geopolitical risk can influence the appropriateness of an investment security or strategy for an investor’s goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A higher likelihood of geopolitical risk can raise or lower an asset class’s expected return or impact a sector or company’s operating environment, affecting its attractiveness for an investment strategy. There is no shortage of ways in which geopolitical risk can impact a portfolio, so identifying, assessing, and tracking geopolitical risk can be difficult and time consuming. It is thus important for investors to map those potential risks to tangible investment outcomes. In this reading, we will build a framework by which investors can measure, assess, track, and react to geopolitical risk, with a goal of improving investment outcomes.

Yield and Yield Spread Measures for Floating-Rate Instruments,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I,"Prior lessons covered pricing, yields, and spreads for bonds with fixed coupon rates and times-to-maturity of one year or longer. The next two lessons broaden the discussion to include instruments with variable rather than fixed coupons, known as floating-rate instruments, and those with original maturities of one year or less, known as money market instruments. Both types of instrument are important for investors and issuers. Floating-rate instruments, by adjusting cash flows to changes in interest rates, bear less price risk than fixed-rate instruments and are used to hedge certain exposures and to match asset and liability cash flows. Most loans are floating-rate instruments. Money market instruments are a significant source of short-term financing for many types of issuers. A short time-to-maturity means that investors can reinvest and issuers can refinance relatively quickly, which reduces interest rate risk.

We then discuss the investment decision-making process and compare analytical approaches employed in that process. In the third lesson, we describe principles of capital allocation and common pitfalls.

Pricing and Valuation of Options​,Derivatives,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Option contracts are contingent claims in which one of the counterparties determines whether and when a trade will settle. Unlike a forward commitment with a value of zero to both counterparties at inception, an option buyer pays a premium to the seller for the right to transact the underlying in the future at an agreed-upon price. The contingent nature of options affects their price as well as their value over time. In the first lesson, we explore three features distinct to contingent claims related to an option’s value versus the spot price of the underlying: (1) the exercise, or intrinsic, value; (2) the relationship between an option’s spot price and its exercise price, referred to as “moneyness”; and (3) the time value. We then turn to how the arbitrage and replication concepts introduced earlier for forward commitments differ when applied to contingent claims with an asymmetric payoff profile. Finally, we identify and describe factors that determine the value of an option. These lessons focus on European options, which can be exercised only at expiration.

The amount of equity is decreased by losses, by dividend payments, or by share repurchases. ","The two types of estimates of a parameter are point estimates and interval estimates. A point estimate is a single number that we use to estimate a parameter. An interval estimate is a range of values that brackets the population parameter with some probability.

A 100(1 − α)% confidence interval for a parameter has the following structure: Point estimate ± Reliability factor × Standard error, where the reliability factor is a number based on the assumed distribution of the point estimate and the degree of confidence (1 − α) for the confidence interval and where standard error is the standard error of the sample statistic providing the point estimate.",www.example.org,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/2020/AH-Refresher-Reading-7
Corporate Structures and Ownership,Corporate Finance,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," In 1997, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, an engineer and a computer scientist, started a company called NuvoMedia to make an electronic book reader they called the Rocket eBook, a precursor to the Kindle eBook popularized by Amazon. Three years after it was founded, NuvoMedia was sold for USD187 million. Soon after, the two entrepreneurs decided to form a new company, this one focused on making electric cars. They named this company in honor of the inventor Nikola Tesla. Because this was a high-risk, capital-intensive endeavor, they used only some of their newfound wealth and sought other investors with expertise in electric vehicles and fundraising capabilities. Elon Musk, an entrepreneur with a shared vision in the commercialization of electric sports cars, joined the team. In addition to making an initial investment of USD6.3 million in Tesla, Musk also helped raise more money from other venture capitalists. Due to conflicts that were not disclosed, Eberhard and Tarpenning resigned just before Tesla came out with its first vehicle, the Roadster, in 2008. Musk took over as CEO and led Tesla’s initial public offering in 2010, which raised USD226 million. In many ways, Tesla’s story is typical of how businesses begin and succeed. They are often started by founders with significant knowledge or technical expertise but who may lack the skills required to manage a business as it grows larger. Capital is needed to fund growth and is initially raised through private channels. Private investors often get involved in the management of the company, especially if they have a large investment at stake. Eventually, even larger amounts of capital are required, and the company is acquired or taken public. Here we examine different forms of business structures, focusing on corporations and the securities they issue to capital providers.

Financial Statement Modeling,Corporate Finance,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Financial statement modeling is a key step in the process of valuing companies and the securities they have issued. We focus on how analysts use industry information and corporate disclosures to forecast a company’s future financial results. An effective financial statement model must be based on a thorough understanding of a company’s business, management, strategy, external environment, and historical results. Thus, an analyst begins with a review of the company and its environment—its industry, key products, strategic position, management, competitors, suppliers, and customers. Using this information, an analyst identifies key revenue and cost drivers and assesses the likely impact of relevant trends, such as economic conditions and technological developments. An analyst’s understanding of the fundamental drivers of the business and assessment of future events provide the basis for forecast model inputs. In other words, financial statement modeling is not merely a quantitative or accounting exercise, it is the quantitative expression of an analyst’s expectations for a company and its competitive environment. We begin our discussion with an overview of developing a revenue forecast. We then describe the general approach to forecasting each of the financial statements and demonstrate the construction of a financial statement model, including forecasted revenue, income statements, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows. Then, we describe five key behavioral biases that influence the modeling process and strategies to mitigate them. We turn to several important topics on the effects of micro- and macroeconomic conditions on financial statement models: the impact of competitive factors on prices and costs, the effects of inflation and deflation, technological developments, and long-term forecasting considerations.

"Categories, Characteristics, and Compensation Structures of Alternative Investments",Alternative Investments,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," “Alternative investments” is a label applied to a disparate group of investments to distinguish them from “traditional investments”—that is, investments in long-only, publicly traded investments in stocks, bonds, and cash. We can think about three major categories of alternative investments based on how they differ from “traditional investments”: One of the key features of alternative investments is that investing in them requires special skills and information. Investing in alternative assets can require handling illiquidity, transacting on private markets, operating sophisticated investment strategies, or risk–return profiles that are different from those of traditional long-only investments.Why Investors Consider Alternative InvestmentsAlternative investments offer a variety of advantages: The 2019 annual report for the Yale University endowment provides one institutional investor’s reasoning for investing in alternatives:The heavy [75.2%] allocation to nontraditional asset classes stems from the diversifying power they provide to the portfolio as a whole. Alternative assets, by their very nature, tend to be less efficiently priced than traditional marketable securities, providing an opportunity to exploit market inefficiencies through active management. Today’s portfolio has significantly higher expected returns and lower volatility than the 1989 portfolio.This quote neatly illustrates the expected characteristics of alternative investments: diversifying power, higher expected returns, and illiquid and potentially less efficient markets. The quote also highlights the importance of having the willingness and the ability to take a long-term perspective. Endowments, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and even family offices allocate increasing portions of their portfolios to alternative investments seeking to benefit from diversification and return opportunities.Alternative investments are not free of risk, of course, and their returns may be correlated with those of other investments, especially in periods of financial crisis. Over a long historical period, the average correlation of returns from alternative investments with those of traditional investments may be low, but in any particular period, the correlation can differ from the average. During periods of economic crisis, correlations among many assets (both alternative and traditional) can increase dramatically.Alternative investments often have many of the following characteristics: As a result of these characteristics, alternative investments often exhibit the following: Categories of Alternative InvestmentsConsidering the variety of alternative investments, it is not surprising that consensus has not been reached on a definitive list of groups or categories. Considerable debate even surrounds the use of categories versus subcategories.

Sovereign governments are distinguished by their right to tax within a jurisdiction, while non-sovereign, quasi-government, and supranational issuers may rely on local taxes, fee-based revenue, or other sources of repayment. Sovereign debt issuance is usually conducted through scheduled public auctions, with a different role for financial intermediaries than in private sector issu- ance.

Performance Calculation and Appraisal of Alternative Investments,Alternative Investments,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Investors frequently look to alternative investments for diversification and a chance to earn relatively high returns on a risk-adjusted basis. Investors also value low correlation and a more risk-neutral source of alpha. Evaluating an alternative investment can be a subtle, qualitative exercise—one that depends on the initial objectives of the investor—as opposed to a purely quantitative, one-size-fits-all exercise. Much of the nuance revolves around not only the total net return created by an alternative investment but also the path and volatility (drawdown risk) required to create the total return as well as how an alternative investment fits into and benefits a larger portfolio of assets—in other words, its portfolio-level correlation benefit. The attraction to alternative investments is often focused on their expected returns, but investors often neglect to consider the atypical risks they present—risks we can examine on both a standalone and portfolio basis:  ","describe issues in performance appraisal of alternative investments, and

Corporate Restructuring,Corporate Finance,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Corporate issuers change over time. Although many changes are evolutionary, such as launching new products and expanding capacity, others involve more revolutionary changes to the legal and accounting structure of the issuer. The most well-known among these structural changes is acquisitions, in which one company buys another. Other well-known changes include divestitures and spin-offs, in which an issuer sells or separates a segment of its business. Common features among these changes are that they tend to attract significant press and analyst attention and their announcement is associated with increased securities trading volume. This reading explains how to evaluate corporate restructurings from the perspective of an independent investment analyst. The discussion begins in Section 2 with an overview of corporate restructurings, including putting these events in the context of the corporate life cycle, and corporate issuers’ motivations for pursuing them. Sections 3 and 4 feature a three-step process for evaluating corporate restructurings as an investment analyst. Sections 5–7 demonstrate the evaluation process with case studies for each major type of corporate restructuring. The reading concludes with a summary and practice problems.

Hedge Funds,Alternative Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II,"Hedge funds originally started as an equity investment vehicle in which offsetting short and long positions protected the overall portfolio against major stock market moves. Today, the name hedge funds is a misnomer. They are not restricted to equities or just hedging strategies. Hedge funds are private pooled investment vehicles that can invest in a wide variety of products, including equities, fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange, private capital, and real assets. It is the investment approach rather than the underlying investments that distinguish hedge funds. Many hedge funds operate in all kinds of financial markets by using leverage, short selling, or using financial instruments that are not often used by other similar commingled funds, such as mutual funds. This may result in a very different risk and return profile than owning underlying assets themselves.The hedge fund industry is in a state of constant change as several hundred new funds are launched each year, with a similar number of funds exiting or being liquidated. While several jurisdictions around the world regulate hedge funds, often they are lightly regulated compared with other investment vehicles.

Pricing and Valuation of Interest Rates and Other Swaps​,Derivatives,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Swap contracts were introduced earlier as a firm commitment to exchange a series of cash flows in the future. Interest rate swaps in which fixed cash flows are exchanged for floating payments are the most common type. Subsequent lessons addressed the pricing and valuation of forward and futures contracts across the term structure, which form the building blocks for swap contracts. In this lesson, we will explore how swap contracts are related to these other forward commitment types. Although financial intermediaries often use forward rate agreements or short-term interest rate futures contracts to manage interest rate exposure, issuers and investors usually prefer swap contracts, because they better match rate-sensitive assets and liabilities with periodic cash flows, such as fixed-coupon bonds, variable-rate loans, or known future commitments. It is important for these market participants not only to be able to match expected future cash flows using swaps but also to ensure that their change in value is consistent with existing or desired underlying exposures. The following lessons compare swap contracts with forward contracts and contrast the value and price of swaps.  ","describe how swap contracts are similar to but different from a series of forward contracts, and

Valuing a Derivative Using a One-Period Binomial Model​,Derivatives,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Earlier lessons explained how the principle of no arbitrage and replication can be used to value and price derivatives. The put–call parity relationship linked put option, call option, underlying asset, and risk-free asset prices. This relationship was extended to forward contracts given the equivalence of an underlying asset position and a long forward contract plus a risk-free bond. Forward commitments can be priced without making assumptions about the underlying asset’s price in the future. However, the pricing of options and other contingent claims requires a model for the evolution of the underlying asset’s future price. The first lesson introduces the widely used binomial model to value European put and call options. A simple one-period version is introduced, which may be extended to multiple periods and used to value more complex contingent claims. In the second lesson, we demonstrate the use of risk-neutral probabilities in derivatives pricing.  ","explain how to value a derivative using a one-period binomial model, and

Credit Analysis for Government Issuers,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I,"This learning module explores special considerations for the credit evaluation of sovereign and other public issuers that often access fixed-income markets to finance their activities.A major difference between corporate and sovereign issuers is the use of proceeds and source of repayment of debt obligations. In contrast to corporations that fund working capital and fixed assets to generate profits, sovereign and other government issuers use debt to conduct fiscal policy, supply public goods and services, and fund other government expenditures. While companies primarily rely on operating cash flow to repay debt, governments use tax revenues and other government revenues, such as tariffs and fees, to pay interest and principal.We analyze sovereign bonds using a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors to assess their ability and willingness to pay. Sovereign defaults are not uncommon, particularly as countries transition from emerging to advanced economies. However, in contrast to corporate issuers, sovereign bondholders are generally unable to force governments to declare bankruptcy and liquidate assets. Non-sovereign issuers, such as certain local governments or quasi-government entities, also issue debt to finance their expenditures or develop infrastructure. This debt is backed by their ability to levy local taxes or generate specific project revenue.

Asset-Backed Security (ABS) Instrument and Market Features,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I,"Prior Learning Modules have shown the funding technique of securitization can be backed by diverse types of assets, including loans and receivables as well as residential or commercial mortgages. A unifying principle in all asset-backed security (ABS) structures is that their underlying cash flows can be reconfigured into various tranches, each with its particular payment pattern to investors and associated risks. The advantage of this targeted partitioning includes a reduction in the variability of cash flows and the reallocation of risks, such as default and early repayment across specific tranches, with associated returns. Overall, ABS securitization provides risk transfer, flexibility to issuers and investors, and efficiency of capital allocation.

The price of a bond and its future cash flows can be used calculate an internal rate of return, known as the yield-to-maturity, which serves as a useful return measure for fixed-income investors under certain assumptions. One of these assumptions that applies to this learning module is that all bond interest and principal cash flows occur as promised. We will explore the relationship between bond prices and bond features, showing how different features affect a bond’s price, and demonstrate pricing both on and between bond coupon dates. Finally, we will introduce matrix pricing, which uses comparable bonds to estimate a bond’s price and yield-to-maturity when neither is known.

"The Term Structure of Interest Rates: Spot, Par, and Forward Curves",Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Prior lessons priced fixed-income instruments by discounting all future cash flows using a single interest rate, such as the yield-to-maturity or a market reference rate (MRR) plus a discount margin. The next three lessons relax this assumption by introducing the term structure of interest rates, or the fact that interest rates vary with time-to-maturity. The ideal data to use for term structure analysis are default-risk-free zero-coupon bonds, known as spot rates or the spot curve. Since these are generally not directly observable, various estimation techniques are used. The spot curve is used to derive two other important yield curves: the par curve and the forward curve. A par curve involves bond yields for hypothetical benchmark securities priced at par, while the forward curve involves rates for interest periods starting in the future. All three of these curves are fundamental to fixed-income analysis and other applications because they represent default-risk-free rates of return for time periods that start today and in the future. We show the pricing of bonds using these different rates and establish their relationships.

Alternative assets differ from the traditional asset classes—debt and equity—due to their unique return, risk, and information profiles and historically show low levels of correlation with debt and equity. Moreover, alternative assets often require highly specialized knowledge to select, manage, and divest these assets. Since these alter- native assets are generally considered to be less liquid than traditional asset classes, understanding the valuation and return characteristics is a specialized skill.

 Curriculum",Level I,"Asset-backed securities (ABS) are securities backed by and repaid from a pooled group of loans or receivables. Creating securities that are repaid from particular types of loans or receivables transfers risk, provides flexibility to issuers and investors, and efficiently allocates capital. In a securitization, cash flows from a designated pool of assets are redistributed by a special purpose issuer to pay interest and principal to investors in a predetermined manner. Thus, ABS transactions create an entire new subordination structure on the designated pool of assets. Securitization takes place around the world — in the Americas, Asia, and Europe.

 Curriculum",Level I,"Earlier lessons demonstrated the relationship between bond prices and yields-to-maturity (YTMs), as well as other features, such as coupon rate and time-to-maturity. Two important considerations for interpreting and determining yields-to-maturity and other yield measures are the assumed frequency of compounding interest and the presence of embedded options that could affect cash flow amounts or timing.

Working Capital & Liquidity,Corporate Finance,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Working capital (also called net working capital) is defined simply as current assets minus current liabilities: (Net) Working capital = Current assets – Current liabilitiesIt includes both operating assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory, as well as financial assets and liabilities, such as short-term investments and short-term debt. Working capital management is the management of a firm’s short-term assets and liabilities and an important aspect of a firm’s operations. The goal of working capital management is to ensure the company has adequate, ready access to funds necessary for day-to-day operations, while avoiding excess reserves that can be a costly drag on the business’ profitability and returns. Having excess levels of working capital can have a harmful effect on shareholder returns. At the same time, insufficient levels of working capital can harm a company if it cannot meet its short-term obligations, leading to product shortages, sales slowdowns, and, in the extreme, bankruptcy. An analyst should carefully evaluate the working capital position of the firm to make an informed decision about the firm’s ability to meet its short-term needs as it works to implement its long-term plans. To assess whether a firm is operating at an optimal level of working capital, financed at the lowest possible cost, an analyst should begin by asking two fundamental questions: Understanding this provides the analyst with a basis for sound valuation analysis.

Fixed-Income Instrument Features,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I,"Fixed-income instruments, such as loans and bonds, are the most common means of financing. Fixed-income issuers include businesses, governments, and not-for-profits that promise to pay interest and repay borrowed principal to investors. Loans are commonly used between an individual or company and a bank. Bonds are more standardized fixed-income instruments designed to be more easily tradeable than loans and are commonly issued by larger companies, governments, and special purpose issuers.

Multinational Operations (2018),Financial Reporting and Analysis,"2018
 Curriculum",Level II," According to the World Trade Organization, merchandise exports worldwide were nearly US$15  trillion in 2010. 1 The amount of worldwide merchandise exports in 2010 was more than twice the amount in 2003 (US$7.4 trillion) and more than four times the amount in 1993 (US$3.7 trillion). The top five exporting countries in 2010, in order, were China, the United States, Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands. In the United States alone, 293,131 companies were identified as exporters in 2010, but only 2.2% of those companies were large (more than 500 employees). 2 The vast majority of US companies with export activity were small or medium-sized entities. The point illustrated by these statistics is that many companies engage in trans - actions that cross national borders. The parties to these transactions must agree on the currency in which to settle the transaction. Generally, this will be the currency of either the buyer or the seller. Exporters that receive payment in foreign currency and allow the purchaser time to pay must carry a foreign currency receivable on their books. Conversely, importers that agree to pay in foreign currency will have a foreign currency account payable. To be able to include them in the total amount of accounts receivable (payable) reported on the balance sheet, these foreign currency denominated accounts receivable (payable) must be translated into the currency in which the exporter (importer) keeps its books and presents financial statements. The prices at which foreign currencies can be purchased or sold are called foreign exchange rates. Because foreign exchange rates fluctuate over time, the value of foreign currency payables and receivables also fluctuates. The major accounting issue related to foreign currency transactions is how to reflect the changes in value for foreign currency payables and receivables in the financial statements. Many companies have operations located in foreign countries. For example, the Swiss food products company Nestlé SA reports that it has factories in 83 countries and a presence in almost every country in the world. US-based Procter & Gamble’s annual filing discloses more than 400 subsidiaries located in more than 80 countries around the world. Foreign subsidiaries are generally required to keep accounting records in the currency of the country in which they are located. To prepare consolidated financial statements, the parent company must translate the foreign currency financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries into its own currency. Nestlé, for example, must translate the assets and liabilities its various foreign subsidiaries carry in foreign currency into Swiss francs to be able to consolidate those amounts with the Swiss franc assets and liabilities located in Switzerland. A multinational company like Nestlé is likely to have two types of foreign currency activities that require special accounting treatment. Most multinationals (1) engage in transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency and (2) invest in foreign subsidiaries that keep their books in a foreign currency. To prepare consolidated financial statements, a multinational company must translate the foreign currency amounts related to both types of international activities into the currency in which the company presents its financial statements. This reading presents the accounting for foreign currency transactions and the translation of foreign currency financial statements. The conceptual issues related to these accounting topics are discussed, and the specific rules embodied in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP are demonstrated through examples. Fortunately, differences between IFRS and US GAAP with respect to foreign currency translation issues are minimal. Analysts need to understand the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the financial statements of a multinational company and how a company’s financial statements reflect foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or not.  ","distinguish among presentation (reporting) currency, functional currency, and local currency;

Natural Resources,Alternative Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I,"Natural resources comprise commodities and raw land used for agricultural purposes, specifically farming and timber. Managing this asset class requires specialized knowledge of the features of natural resources. An increasing number of portfolios include natural resources, which justifies a separate examination of the sector. There has been rapid development in offering indirect investment in natural resources through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), limited partnerships, REITs, swaps, and futures.Commodities, such as crude oil, soybeans, copper, and gold, are seen as investments. Investments in commodities can be either “hard” (those mined, such as copper, or extracted, such as oil) or “soft” (those grown over a period of time, such as livestock, grains, and cash crops, such as coffee).Timberland investment involves ownership of raw land and the harvesting of its trees for lumber, thus generating an income stream and the potential for capital gain, and timberland has been included in large institutional portfolios for decades. Farmland as an investment is a more recent phenomenon, with only a few dedicated funds involved. With population growth, weather, and water management becoming more topical, however, investors may turn to these assets to actively address sustainability.

 Curriculum",Level I,"Broadly defined, real estate comprises land and buildings. Real estate investments involve developed land, including commercial and industrial real estate and residential real estate. Real estate has some unique features, including heterogeneity (no two properties are identical), long lives, and fixed geographical or physical location.Raw land and less developed land used in agriculture and forestry are categorized as natural resource investments, while infrastructure involves land, buildings, and other fixed assets developed by public entities or public–private partnerships for economic use. Investments in real estate and infrastructure are included in many portfolios because they tend to exhibit low correlations with traditional asset classes and provide risk and return combinations across a broad spectrum.

Credit Analysis for Corporate Issuers,Fixed Income,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I,"In this learning module, we focus on the relative creditworthiness of non-financial corporate borrowers, building on earlier learning modules on corporate issuers as well as the earlier fixed-income module on credit risk and its components.In particular, we assess a company’s activities, or its business model, and how this affects the company’s ability to meet its debt obligations. While a company’s probability of default (POD) and loss given default (LGD) are not directly observable, in the first lesson we consider qualitative and quantitative factors that affect these credit risk components. Financial statement analysis and cash flow projections are important tools used to conduct corporate credit analysis. The second lesson applies these tools to calculate and interpret a variety of financial ratios, including profitability, lever- age, and coverage metrics, to assess an issuer’s probability of default. The seniority rankings of specific debt issues and use of collateral are of particular importance in determining credit ratings for a corporate issue and assessing the LGD in an event of default, which is addressed in the third and final lesson.

Fixed-income indexes are categorized in a similar manner and serve important functions, like the role of equity market indexes in stock markets. Like other financial markets, fixed-income markets are composed of primary markets in which issuers raise financing from investors with new issues and secondary markets where investors trade existing instruments with other investors.

Investments in Real Estate through Publicly Traded Securities,Alternative Investments,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," Historically real estate investing was reserved for the wealthy and institutions. REITs were initially conceived of as a way for small investors to gain exposure to a professionally managed, diversified real estate portfolio. REITs were viewed as a type of (closed-end) mutual fund and income passthrough vehicle through which the portfolio manager would acquire attractively valued properties, occasionally sell fully valued properties, and distribute property earnings to the trust’s investors. Legislation was passed in the United States in 1960 to authorize REITs, and the Netherlands followed suit in 1969. The US model and other types of tax-advantaged real estate investment vehicles have been adopted worldwide. The S&P 500 Index added REITs as a separate GICS sector in 2016. As of October 2020, more than 35 countries have REITs or REIT-like structures, more are considering adopting similar vehicles, and REITs are held by individuals and institutions alike.

Cost of Capital: Advanced Topics,Corporate Finance,"2024
 Curriculum",Level II," A company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents the cost of debt and equity capital used by the company to finance its assets. The cost of debt is the after-tax cost to the issuer of debt, based on the return that debt investors require to finance a company. The cost of equity represents the return that equity investors require to own a company, also referred to as the required rate of return on equity or the required return on equity. A company’s WACC is used by the company’s internal decision makers to evaluate capital investments. For analysts and investors, it is a critical input used in company valuation. Equation (1) shows how a company’s WACC is driven by the proportions, or weights (thewi), of the different capital sources used in its capital structure, applied to the costs of each source (theri): WACC =wdrd(1 – t) +wprp+were, whered,p, andedenote debt, preferred equity, and common equity, respectively. These weights are all non-negative and sum to 1.0. Determining a company’s WACC is an important, albeit challenging, task for an analyst given the following: Estimating the cost of capital for a company thus involves numerous, sometimes complex, assumptions and choices, all of which affect the resulting investment conclusion.

"Arbitrage, Replication, and the Cost of Carry in Pricing Derivatives​",Derivatives,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Earlier derivative lessons established the features of derivative instruments and markets and addressed both the benefits and risks associated with their use. Forward commitments and contingent claims were distinguished by their different payoff profiles and other characteristics. We now turn our attention to the pricing and valuation of these instruments. As a first step, we explore how the price of a forward commitment is related to the spot price of an underlying asset in a way that does not allow for arbitrage opportunities. Specifically, the strategy of replication shows that identical payoffs to a forward commitment can be achieved from spot market transactions combined with borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate. Finally, the second lesson demonstrates how costs or benefits associated with owning an underlying asset affect the forward commitment price.

"Private Capital, Real Estate, Infrastructure, Natural Resources, and Hedge Funds",Alternative Investments,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Private capital is the broad term for funding provided to companies that is sourced neither from the public markets, such as from the sale of equities, bonds, and other securities on exchanges, nor from traditional institutional providers, such as a government or bank. Capital raised from sources other than public markets and traditional institutions and in the form of an equity investment is called private equity (PE). Similarly sourced capital extended to companies through a loan or other form of debt is referred to as private debt. Private capital relates to the entire capital structure, including PE and private debt. Private capital largely consists of private investment funds and entities that invest in the equity or debt securities of privately held companies, real estate, or other assets. Many private investment firms have PE and private debt arms; however, these teams typically refrain from investing in the same assets or businesses to avoid overexposure to a single investment and to avoid the conflict of interest that arises from being invested in both the equity and debt of an issuer. Private investment firms, even those with private debt arms, typically are referred to as PE firms. Although PE is the largest component of private capital, PE as a comprehensive generic category is inaccurate because other forms of private alternative finance have grown considerably in size and popularity.

Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts and for an Underlying with Varying Maturities​,Derivatives,"2024
 Curriculum",Level I," Earlier lessons introduced forward commitment features, payoff profiles, and concepts used in pricing these derivative instruments. In particular, the relationship between spot and forward commitment prices was established as the opportunity cost of owning the underlying asset (represented by the risk-free rate) as well as any additional cost or benefit associated with holding the underlying asset. This price relationship both prevents arbitrage and allows a forward commitment to be replicated using spot market transactions and risk-free borrowing or lending. n the first lesson, we explore the pricing and valuation of forward commitments on a mark-to-market (MTM) basis from inception through maturity. This analysis is essential for issuers, investors, and financial intermediaries to assess the value of any asset or liability portfolio that includes these instruments. The second lesson addresses forward pricing for the special case of underlying assets with different maturities, such as interest rates, credit spreads, and volatility. The prices of these forward commitments across the so-called term structure are important building blocks for pricing swaps and related instruments in later lessons.

Option Replication Using Put-Call Parity​,Derivatives,"2023
 Curriculum",Level I," Previous lessons examined the payoff and profit profiles of call options and put options, the upper and lower bounds of an option’s value, and the factors impacting option values. In doing so, we contrasted the asymmetry of one-sided option payoffs with the linear or symmetric payoff of forwards and underlying assets. We now extend this analysis to show how to combine options to have an equivalent payoff to that of the underlying and a risk-free asset as well as a forward commitment. In the first lesson, we demonstrate that the value of a European call may be used to derive the value of a European put option with the same underlying details, and vice versa, under a no-arbitrage condition referred to as put–call parity. In the second lesson, we show how this may be extended to forward commitments and how the put–call parity relationship may be applied to option and other investment strategies. We will focus on European options on underlying assets with no income or benefit.  ","explain put–call parity for European options, and
