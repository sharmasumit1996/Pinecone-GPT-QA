Time Value of Money in Finance,Quantitative Methods,"2024",Level I," As individuals, we often face decisions that involve saving money for a future use, or borrowing money for current consumption. We then need to determine the amount we need to invest, if we are saving, or the cost of borrowing, if we are shopping for a loan. As investment analysts, much of our work also involves evaluating transactions with present and future cash flows. When we place a value on any security, for example, we are attempting to determine the worth of a stream of future cash flows. To carry out all the above tasks accurately, we must understand the mathematics of time value of money problems. Money has time value in that individuals value a given amount of money more highly the earlier it is received. Therefore, a smaller amount of money now may be equivalent in value to a larger amount received at a future date. Thetime value of moneyas a topic in investment mathematics deals with equivalence relationships between cash flows with different dates. Mastery of time value of money concepts and techniques is essential for investment analysts. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces some terminology used throughout the reading and supplies some economic intuition for the variables we will discuss. Section 3 tackles the problem of determining the worth at a future point in time of an amount invested today. Section 4 addresses the future worth of a series of cash flows. These two sections provide the tools for calculating the equivalent value at a future date of a single cash flow or series of cash flows. Sections 5 and 6 discuss the equivalent value today of a single future cash flow and a series of future cash flows, respectively. In Section 7, we explore how to determine other quantities of interest in time value of money problems.  ","interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs;

An interest rate can be viewed as the sum of the real risk-free interest rate and a set of premiums that compensate lenders for risk: an inflation premium, a default risk premium, a liquidity premium, and a maturity premium.
The future value, FV, is the present value, PV, times the future value factor, (1 +r)N.
The interest rate,r, makes current and future currency amounts equivalent based on their time value.
The stated annual interest rate is a quoted interest rate that does not account for compounding within the year.
The periodic rate is the quoted interest rate per period; it equals the stated annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods per year.
The effective annual rate is the amount by which a unit of currency will grow in a year with interest on interest included.
An annuity is a finite set of level sequential cash flows.
There are two types of annuities, the annuity due and the ordinary annuity. The annuity due has a first cash flow that occurs immediately; the ordinary annuity has a first cash flow that occurs one period from the present (indexed att= 1).
On a time line, we can index the present as 0 and then display equally spaced hash marks to represent a number of periods into the future. This representation allows us to index how many periods away each cash flow will be paid.
Annuities may be handled in a similar approach as single payments if we use annuity factors rather than single-payment factors.
The present value, PV, is the future value, FV, times the present value factor, (1 +r)−N.
The present value of a perpetuity isA/r, whereAis the periodic payment to be received forever.
It is possible to calculate an unknown variable, given the other relevant variables in time value of money problems.
The cash flow additivity principle can be used to solve problems with uneven cash flows by combining single payments and annuities."
Common Probability Distributions,Quantitative Methods,"2021",Level I," In nearly all investment decisions we work with random variables. The return on a
stock and its earnings per share are familiar examples of random variables. To make
probability statements about a random variable, we need to understand its probability
distribution. Aprobability distributionspecifies the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a random variable. In this reading, we present important facts about four probability distributions and
their investment uses. These four distributions—the uniform, binomial, normal, and
lognormal—are used extensively in investment analysis. They are used in such basic
valuation models as the Black–Scholes–Merton option pricing model, the binomial option
pricing model, and the capital asset pricing model. With the working knowledge of
probability distributions provided in this reading, you will also be better prepared
to study and use other quantitative methods such as hypothesis testing, regression
analysis, and time-series analysis. After discussing probability distributions, we end the reading with a brief introduction
to Monte Carlo simulation, a computer-based tool for obtaining information on complex
problems. For example, an investment analyst may want to experiment with an investment
idea without actually implementing it. Or she may need to price a complex option for
which no simple pricing formula exists. In these cases and many others, Monte Carlo
simulation is an important resource. To conduct a Monte Carlo simulation, the analyst
must identify risk factors associated with the problem and specify probability distributions
for them. Hence, Monte Carlo simulation is a tool that requires an understanding of
probability distributions. Before we discuss specific probability distributions, we define basic concepts and
terms. We then illustrate the operation of these concepts through the simplest distribution,
the uniform distribution. That done, we address probability distributions that have
more applications in investment work but also greater complexity.  ","define a probability distribution and distinguish between discrete and continuous

describe Monte Carlo simulation.",https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/common-probability-distributions.pdf,"A probability distribution specifies the probabilities of the possible outcomes of
    a random variable.
The two basic types of random variables are discrete random variables and continuous
    random variables. Discrete random variables take on at most a countable number of
    possible outcomes that we can list asx1,x2, … In contrast, we cannot describe the possible outcomes of a continuous random variableZwith a listz1,z2, … because the outcome (z1+z2)/2, not in the list, would always be possible.
The probability function specifies the probability that the random variable will take
    on a specific value. The probability function is denotedp(x) for a discrete random variable andf(x) for a continuous random variable. For any probability functionp(x), 0 ≤p(x) ≤ 1, and the sum ofp(x) over all values ofXequals 1.
The cumulative distribution function, denotedF(x) for both continuous and discrete random variables, gives the probability that the
    random variable is less than or equal tox.
The discrete uniform and the continuous uniform distributions are the distributions
    of equally likely outcomes.
The binomial random variable is defined as the number of successes innBernoulli trials, where the probability of success,p, is constant for all trials and the trials are independent. A Bernoulli trial is
    an experiment with two outcomes, which can represent success or failure, an up move
    or a down move, or another binary (two-fold) outcome.
A binomial random variable has an expected value or mean equal tonpand variance equal tonp(1 −p).
A binomial tree is the graphical representation of a model of asset price dynamics
    in which, at each period, the asset moves up with probabilitypor down with probability (1 −p). The binomial tree is a flexible method for modeling asset price movement and is
    widely used in pricing options.
The normal distribution is a continuous symmetric probability distribution that is completely described by two parameters: its mean, μ, and its variance, σ2.
A univariate distribution specifies the probabilities for a single random variable.
    A multivariate distribution specifies the probabilities for a group of related random
    variables.
To specify the normal distribution for a portfolio when its component securities are
    normally distributed, we need the means, standard deviations, and all the distinct
    pairwise correlations of the securities. When we have those statistics, we have also
    specified a multivariate normal distribution for the securities.
For a normal random variable, approximately 68 percent of all possible outcomes are
    within a one standard deviation interval about the mean, approximately 95 percent
    are within a two standard deviation interval about the mean, and approximately 99
    percent are within a three standard deviation interval about the mean.
A normal random variable,X, is standardized using the expressionZ= (X− μ)/σ, where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation ofX.Generally, we use the sample mean¯¯¯XX¯as an estimate of μ and the sample standard deviationsas an estimate of σ in this expression.
The standard normal random variable, denotedZ, has a mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 1. All questions about any normal random
    variable can be answered by referring to the cumulative distribution function of a
    standard normal random variable, denotedN(x) orN(z).
Shortfall risk is the risk that portfolio value will fall below some minimum acceptable
    level over some time horizon.
Roy’s safety-first criterion, addressing shortfall risk, asserts that the optimal
    portfolio is the one that minimizes the probability that portfolio return falls below
    a threshold level. According to Roy’s safety-first criterion, if returns are normally
    distributed, the safety-first optimal portfolioPis the one that maximizes the quantity [E(RP) −RL]/σP, whereRLis the minimum acceptable level of return.
A random variable follows a lognormal distribution if the natural logarithm of the
    random variable is normally distributed. The lognormal distribution is defined in
    terms of the mean and variance of its associated normal distribution. The lognormal
    distribution is bounded below by 0 and skewed to the right (it has a long right tail).
The lognormal distribution is frequently used to model the probability distribution
    of asset prices because it is bounded below by zero.
Continuous compounding views time as essentially continuous or unbroken; discrete
    compounding views time as advancing in discrete finite intervals.
The continuously compounded return associated with a holding period is the natural
    log of 1 plus the holding period return, or equivalently, the natural log of ending
    price over beginning price.
If continuously compounded returns are normally distributed, asset prices are lognormally
    distributed. This relationship is used to move back and forth between the distributions
    for return and price. Because of the central limit theorem, continuously compounded
    returns need not be normally distributed for asset prices to be reasonably well described
    by a lognormal distribution.
Monte Carlo simulation involves the use of a computer to represent the operation of
    a complex financial system. A characteristic feature of Monte Carlo simulation is
    the generation of a large number of random samples from specified probability distribution(s)
    to represent the operation of risk in the system. Monte Carlo simulation is used in
    planning, in financial risk management, and in valuing complex securities. Monte Carlo
    simulation is a complement to analytical methods but provides only statistical estimates,
    not exact results."
Basics of Multiple Regression and Underlying Assumptions,Quantitative Methods,"2024",Level II," Multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to describe the variation of the dependent variable rather than just one independent variable, as in simple linear regression. It allows the analyst to estimate using more complex models with multiple explanatory variables and, if used correctly, may lead to better predictions, better portfolio construction, or better understanding of the drivers of security returns. If used incorrectly, however, multiple linear regression may yield spurious relationships, lead to poor predictions, and offer a poor understanding of relationships. The analyst must first specify the model and make several decisions in this process. The analyst must answer the following questions: What is the dependent variable of interest? What independent variables are important? What form should the model take? What is the goal of the model—prediction or understanding of the relationship? The analyst specifies the dependent and independent variables and then employs software to estimate the model and produce related statistics. The good news is that the software does the estimation (see Exhibit 1). The analyst’s primary tasks are to specify the model and interpret the output from this software, which are the main subjects of this content.

In practice, multiple regressions are used to explain relationships between financial variables, to test existing theories, or to make forecasts.
The regression process covers several decisions the analyst must make, such as identifying the dependent and independent variables, selecting the appropriate regression model, testing if the assumptions behind linear regression are satisfied, examining goodness of fit, and making needed adjustments.
We have presented the multiple linear regression model and discussed violations of
    regression assumptions, model specification and misspecification, and models with
    qualitative variables.
A multiple regression model is represented by the following equation:
Coefficientb0is the model’s “intercept,” representing the expected value ofYif all independent variables are zero.
Parametersb1tobkare the slope coefficients (or partial regression coefficients) for independent variablesX1toXk. Slope coefficientbjdescribes the impact of independent variableXjonY, holding all the other independent variables constant.
Five main assumptions underlying multiple regression models must be satisfied: (1) linearity, (2) homoskedasticity, (3) independence of errors, (4) normality, and (5) independence of independent variables.
Diagnostic plots can help detect whether these assumptions are satisfied. Scatterplots of dependent versus and independent variables are useful for detecting nonlinear relationships, while residual plots are useful for detecting violations of homoskedasticity and independence of errors."
Probability Concepts,Quantitative Methods,"2023",Level I," Investment decisions are made in a risky environment. The tools that allow us to make decisions with consistency and logic in this setting are based on probability concepts. This reading presents the essential probability tools needed to frame and address many real-world problems involving risk. These tools apply to a variety of issues, such as predicting investment manager performance, forecasting financial variables, and pricing bonds so that they fairly compensate bondholders for default risk. Our focus is practical. We explore the concepts that are most important to investment research and practice. Among these are independence, as it relates to the predictability of returns and financial variables; expectation, as analysts continually look to the future in their analyses and decisions; and variability, variance or dispersion around expectation, as a risk concept important in investments. The reader will acquire specific skills and competencies in using these probability concepts to understand risks and returns on investments.  ","define a random variable, an outcome, and an event;

Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that describes the chance that a stated event
    will occur.
An event is a specified set of outcomes of a random variable.
Mutually exclusive events can occur only one at a time. Exhaustive events cover or
    contain all possible outcomes.
The two defining properties of a probability are, first, that 0 ≤P(E) ≤ 1 (whereP(E) denotes the probability of an eventE), and second, that the sum of the probabilities of any set of mutually exclusive
    and exhaustive events equals 1.
A probability estimated from data as a relative frequency of occurrence is an empirical
    probability. A probability drawing on personal or subjective judgment is a subjective
    probability. A probability obtained based on logical analysis is an a priori probability.
A probability of an eventE,P(E), can be stated as odds forE=P(E)/[1 −P(E)] or odds againstE= [1 −P(E)]/P(E).
Probabilities that are inconsistent create profit opportunities, according to the
    Dutch Book Theorem.
A probability of an eventnotconditioned on another event is an unconditional probability. The unconditional probability
    of an eventAis denotedP(A). Unconditional probabilities are also called marginal probabilities.
A probability of an event given (conditioned on) another event is a conditional probability.
    The probability of an eventAgiven an eventBis denotedP(A|B), andP(A|B) =P(AB)/P(B),P(B) ≠ 0.
The probability of bothAandBoccurring is the joint probability ofAandB, denotedP(AB).
The multiplication rule for probabilities isP(AB) =P(A|B)P(B).
The probability thatAorBoccurs, or both occur, is denoted byP(AorB).
The addition rule for probabilities isP(AorB) =P(A) +P(B) −P(AB).
When events are independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability
    of occurrence of the other event. Otherwise, the events are dependent.
The multiplication rule for independent events states that ifAandBare independent events,P(AB) =P(A)P(B). The rule generalizes in similar fashion to more than two events.
According to the total probability rule, ifS1,S2, …,Snare mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios or events, thenP(A) =P(A|S1)P(S1) +P(A|S2)P(S2) + … +P(A|Sn)P(Sn).
The expected value of a random variable is a probability-weighted average of the possible
    outcomes of the random variable. For a random variableX, the expected value ofXis denotedE(X).
The total probability rule for expected value states thatE(X) =E(X|S1)P(S1) +E(X|S2)P(S2) + … +E(X|Sn)P(Sn), whereS1,S2, …,Snare mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios or events.
The variance of a random variable is the expected value (the probability-weighted
    average) of squared deviations from the random variable’s expected valueE(X): σ2(X) =E{[X−E(X)]2}, where σ2(X) stands for the variance ofX.
Variance is a measure of dispersion about the mean. Increasing variance indicates
    increasing dispersion. Variance is measured in squared units of the original variable.
Standard deviation is the positive square root of variance. Standard deviation measures
    dispersion (as does variance), but it is measured in the same units as the variable.
Covariance is a measure of the co-movement between random variables.
The covariance between two random variablesRiandRjin a forward-looking sense is the expected value of the cross-product of the deviations
    of the two random variables from their respective means: Cov(Ri,Rj) =E{[Ri−E(Ri)][Rj−E(Rj)]}. The covariance of a random variable with itself is its own variance.
The historical or sample covariance between two random variablesRiandRjbased on a sample of past data of sizenis the average value of the product of the deviations of observations on two random
    variables from their sample means:Cov(Ri,Rj)=n∑i=1(Ri,t−¯¯¯Ri)(Rj,t−¯¯¯Rj)/(n−1)Cov(Ri,Rj)=∑i=1n(Ri,t−R¯i)(Rj,t−R¯j)/(n−1)
Correlation is a number between −1 and +1 that measures the co-movement (linear association) between two random variables: ρ(Ri,Rj) = Cov(Ri,Rj)/[σ(Ri) σ(Rj)].
If two variables have a very strong linear relation, then the absolute value of their
    correlation will be close to 1. If two variables have a weak linear relation, then
    the absolute value of their correlation will be close to 0.
If the correlation coefficient is positive, the two variables are directly related;
    if the correlation coefficient is negative, the two variables are inversely related.
To calculate the variance of return on a portfolio ofnassets, the inputs needed are thenexpected returns on the individual assets,nvariances of return on the individual assets, andn(n− 1)/2 distinct covariances.
Portfolio variance of return isσ2(Rp)=n∑i=1n∑j=1wiwjCov(Ri,Rj)σ2(Rp)=∑i=1n∑j=1nwiwjCov(Ri,Rj).
The calculation of covariance in a forward-looking sense requires the specification
    of a joint probability function, which gives the probability of joint occurrences
    of values of the two random variables.
When two random variables are independent, the joint probability function is the product
    of the individual probability functions of the random variables.
Bayes’ formula is a method for updating probabilities based on new information.
Bayes’ formula is expressed as follows: Updated probability of event given the new information = [(Probability of the new information given event)/(Unconditional probability of the new information)] × Prior probability of event.
The multiplication rule of counting says, for example, that if the first step in a
    process can be done in 10 ways, the second step, given the first, can be done in 5
    ways, and the third step, given the first two, can be done in 7 ways, then the steps
    can be carried out in (10)(5)(7) = 350 ways.
The number of ways to assign every member of a group of sizentonslots isn! =n(n− 1) (n− 2)(n− 3) … 1. (By convention, 0! = 1.)
The number of ways thatnobjects can be labeled withkdifferent labels, withn1of the first type,n2of the second type, and so on, withn1+n2+ … +nk=n, is given byn!/(n1!n2! …nk!). This expression is the multinomial formula.
