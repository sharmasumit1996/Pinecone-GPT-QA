ANSWER:  B 
“Global Investment Performance Standards,” CFA Institute, 2005 
2009 Modular Level I, Vol. 1, p. 134  
Study Session  1–4–b 
Describe the scope of the GIPS standards with respect to an investment firm’s definition 
and historical performance  record.  
 
A reorganization of a firm does not permit any alteration of historical composite results. 
A firm is defined as a distinct business entity and does not include fund sponsors or 
consultants.  
Total firm assets must be the aggregate of the market value of all discretionary and 
nondiscretionary assets under management within the defined firm. This inc ludes both 
fee-paying and non -fee-paying  assets.  
 
 
4. Under which measurement scale is data categorized, but not  ranked?  
 
A. An ordinal  scale.  
B. A nominal  scale.  
C. An interval  scale.  
 
ANSWER:  B 
“Statistical Concepts and Market Returns,” Richard A. Defusco, Dennis W.  McLeavey, 
Jerald E. Pinto, and David E.  Runkle  
2009 Modular Level I, Vol. 1, page 242 
Study Session  2-7-a 

Differentiate between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, between a population 
and a sample, and among the types of measurement  scales.  
 
Data is categorized, but not ranked under a nominal scale. Under an ordinal scale data is 
ranked, while under an interval scale, data is ranked and separated by equal  intervals.  
 
 
5. The joint probability of events A and B is 32 percent with the probability of event A 
being 60 percent and the probability of event B being 50 percent. Based on this 
information, the conditional probability of event A given event B has occurred is closest 
to: 
 
A.  30.0%.  
B.  53.3%.  
C.  64.0%.  
 
ANSWER:  C 
“Prob ability Concepts,” Richard A. Defusco, Dennis W. McLeavey, Jerald E. Pinto, and 
David E.  Runkle  
2009 Modular Level I, Vol. 1, p. 325 
Study Session 2 -8-d, e 
Distinguish between unconditional and conditional  probability.  
Calculate and interpret 1) the joint probability of two events, 2) the probability that at 
least one of the two events will occur, given the probability of each and the joint 
probability of the two events, and 3) a joint probability of any number of independent 
events.  
 
The conditional probab ility of A given that B has occurred is equal to the joint 
probability of A and B divided by the probability of B. In this case, P(A|B) = 
P(AB)/P(B) = 32%/50% =  64.0%.  
 
 
6. If a firm’s long -run average cost of production increases by 15 percent as a result of an 8 percent 
increase in production the firm is most likely  experiencing:  
 
A. economies of  scale.

Explain the firm’s production function, its properties of diminishing returns and diminishing 
marginal product of capital, the relation between short -run and long -run costs, a nd how 
economies and diseconomies of scale affect long -run costs.  

As a company faces diseconomies of scale when long -term average production costs rise faster 
than increases in production. When diseconomies of scale are present, the LRAC curve sl opes 
upward. The main source of diseconomies of scale is the difficulty of managing a very large 
enterprise.  
 
 
7. A company currently has a debt -to-equity ratio of 1.25.  Common shareholder’s equity  is 
$4,000,000, consisting of 1.5 million shares outstanding with a current price of $28/share.

Study Session 9 -38-e, 10-39-d 
Describe two  types of debt with equity features (convertible debt and debt with warrants) 
and calculate the effect of issuance of such instruments on a company’s debt  ratios.  
Demonstrate how ratios are related and how to evaluate a company using a combination 
of diffe rent ratios.  
 
Under U.S. GAAP, if the bonds are converted, liabilities are decreased by the book value 
of the bonds, and the equity is increased by the same  amount.  
Debt/Equity = 1.25; Equity = $4,000,000 
Debt = 1.25 x $4,000,000 =  $5,000,000  
Shares issued  on conversion: $1,000,000/$1,000/bond x 50 shares/bond = 50,000 shares 
Equity Issued:  $1,000,000  
Debt Reduction: $1,000,000 resulting in $4,000,000  outstanding  
New Debt/Capital ratio: Debt/(Debt + Equity) = $4,000,000/($4,000,000+$5,000,000) = 
44.4%  

8. A company has just issued $5 million of mandatory redeemable preferred shares with a

Which of the following statements is least likely correct?  The  company’s:  
 
A. Debt/Total capital ratio will  improve.  
B. interest coverage ratio will  deteriorate.  
C. preferred shareholders will rank below debt holders should the company file for 
bankruptcy.  
 
ANSWER:  A 
“Understanding the Balance Sheet,” Thomas R. Robinson, CFA, Jan Hendrik van 
Greuning, CFA, R. Elaine Henry, CFA, and Michael A. Broihahn,  CFA  
2009 Modular Level I, Vol. 3, p.220  
"Long -term Liabilities and Leases,” Elizabeth Gordon and R. Elaine Henry, CFA 
2009 Modular Level I, Vol. 3 pp.  442-445 
Study Session 8 -33-h, 9-38-c, 
Describe the presentation of, and disclosures relating to, financing liabilities. 
List and explain the components of owners’  equity.  
 
SFAS 150 require that issuers report as liabilities any financial instruments that will 
require repayment of principal in t he future. Mandatory redeemable preferred shares 
(which used to be reported as equity) now must be reported as debt; dividends on such 
stock must be reported as interest expense (consistent with the view that the preferred 
stock is  debt).  
 
In the Debt/(De bt + Equity) ratio, the Debt will increase making the debt/total capital 
increase, (the numerator will increase more than the denominator), thus the ratio will 
increase (deteriorate), not decrease  (improve).

ANSWER:  B 
“Capital Budgeting,” John D. Stowe and Ja cques R. Gagné 
2009 Modular Level I, Vol. 4, pp.  19-21 
Study Session  11-44-e 
Explain the NPV profile, compare and contrast the NPV and IRR methods when 
evaluating independent and mutually -exclusive projects, and describe the problems that 
can arise when us ing an  IRR.  
A delay in the receipt of cash flows (as in Project 2) will make a project’s net present 
value more sensitive to changes in the discount rate; the increased sensitivity is illustrated 
by a steeper slope in the net present value  profile.  
 
 
12. A com pany wants to determine the cost of equity to use in the calculation of its weighted 
average cost of capital.  The CFO has gathered the following  information:  
 
Rate of return on 3 -month Treasury  bills 3.0%  
Rate of return on 10 -year Treasury  bonds  3.5%  
Market equity risk  premium  6.0%  
The company’s estimated  beta 1.6 
The company’s after -tax cost of  debt 8.0%  
Risk premium of equity over  debt 4.0%

Using the bond -yield -plus-risk-premium approach, the cost of equity for the company  is 
closest  to: 
 
A.  10.6%.  
B.  12.0%.  
C.  16.3%.  
 
ANSWER:  C 
“Cost of Capital,” Yves Courtois, Gene C. Lai, and Pamela P. Peterson 
2009 Modular Level I, Vol. 4, p. 53  
Study Session  11-45-h 
Calculate and interpret the cost of equity capital using  the capital asset pricing model 
approach, the dividend discount model approach, and the bond -yield -plus risk -premium 
approach.  
 
The cost of equity using bond -yield -plus-risk-premium approach is the before -tax cost of 
debt plus the risk premium of equity o ver debt. The before -tax cost of debt is the after - 
tax cost divided by 1 minus the tax rate. 8.0%/(1 – 0.35) = 12.3%. Adding the risk 
premium results in 12.3% + 4% =  16.3%.

$75, the preferred stock is most appropriately described as  being:  
 
A. overvalued by  $11.36.  
B. undervalued by  $15.13.  
C. undervalued by  $36.36.  
 
ANSWER:  A
