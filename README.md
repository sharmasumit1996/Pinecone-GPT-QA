# PineCone & OpenAI LLM integration for QnA development

## Problem Statement

As part of the "Development of a Structured Database and Text Extraction System for Finance Professional Development Resources," we are tasked with creating a comprehensive system that leverages cutting-edge technologies to address the ongoing challenge of effectively curating and utilizing vast amounts of professional development content from various sources. The finance industry, with its depth and complexity of content, particularly benefits from systems that can automate and enhance the retrieval, understanding, and interaction with professional and developmental materials.

## Project Goals

The objective of this project is to design and implement a structured database system that uses Models as a Service APIs to build intelligent applications capable of handling complex knowledge retrieval and question/answer tasks. This system will be developed using Pinecone and OpenAI's APIs to harness the power of vector databases and advanced natural language processing models.

The key components of the project include:

1. **Creation of Knowledge Summaries**: Utilizing OpenAI's GPT to generate comprehensive summaries from the CFA Institute’s professional development materials which include introductions, summaries, and Learning Outcome Statements (LOS).
2. **Development of a Contextual Knowledge Base**: Constructing a dynamic Q/A database that not only stores information but also provides contextual answers based on the content extracted and summarized from the designated resources.
3. **Implementation of a Vector Database**: Using Pinecone to manage and retrieve knowledge pieces efficiently, enabling the system to find and answer complex queries with high accuracy and speed.
4. **Single-Click Operational Interface**: Designing a user-friendly API and interface that allows end-users, specifically financial analysts, to interact with the system seamlessly. This interface will support single-click operations to execute tasks such as data extraction, summary generation, and query handling.
5. **Automation and Scalability**: Automating the entire process using AirFlow to ensure that the system is not only effective in real-time but also scalable for future expansions and capable of integrating additional data sources and analytical tools.
